I am Arman, and I will be your guide. Let’s start with a 5 minute meditation called ‘The Rocking Chair’. Get comfortable, put your cell phone on silent, turn off the TV, dim the lights and close your eyes. Put on some soft music if it helps you relax.\n\nReady? Now picture yourself in this rocking chair, at 90 years old. You are with your grandchildren, reflecting on your life as the sun gracefully sets in the distance. Your grand kids want to know about your life. What will you share with them? \n\nKeep your eyes closed and meditate on this deeply – your life, what it has been, and how you will tell this story to the next generation.\n\nOK, come back to present day and compare who you are right now, in relation to that 90-year-old man or woman whose eyes you just saw the world through for the last 5 minutes.","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"38iymD0qlysIe2k8EU2Uyc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-14T13:55:28.134Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-20T15:24:16.984Z","revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"2mLuHNEWt6642qmEyiU6si","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:18:11.604Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:18:11.604Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"а1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/2mLuHNEWt6642qmEyiU6si/6437c8d5cfe44214b4826e52685539a0/__1.png","details":{"size":1877,"image":{"width":187,"height":202}},"fileName":"а1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"What are your __best memories__?

How much time do you estimate spending on each area in a given week (168 hours)? What specifically would you like to do more of? Less of? Who would you like to spend more time with? Less time with? Where would you like to spend more time, and less time? \n\nCreate your own Life Catego- ries, and use whatever naming conventions you prefer.  You will find that we all share certain core activities. Sleep is sleep, work is work, etc. I break down my life activities into 7 main categories and 40 or so sub-areas (i.e., “bugs”) within those 7 categories. I call those sub-areas “bugs”, which is where the concept for Timebug was born.

What has been holding you back from reaching your full potential? Our vices can completely disrupt and ruin otherwise happy and fruitful lives. Now isn’t the time to focus only on the positives and brush those character flaws under the rug. It is also quite rare to witness people living at their full potential; but when you come across those who are at or close to that level, you can feel them beaming with energy, and see how happy – and effective - they are. Do you know someone like that? If so, take note for future role modeling exercises. \n\nIn the movie, Lucy, Morgan Freeman gives a great lecture about what might happen if human beings start using more than 10% of our brains. I definitely recommend watching it. Freeman notes, “One hundred billion neurons per human of which only fifteen percent are activated. There are more connections in the human body than there are stars in the galaxy. We possess a gigantic network of information to which we have almost no access.”\n\nCan you be objective about your own strengths and weaknesses? Objectivity is one of the cornerstones of wisdom and maturity and it is one of the most difficult qualities to possess.  It requires us to see ourselves clearly, without bias and judgment – not an easy task. Ask yourself what kind of impression you make on people (not just the first impression, but over time). See yourself through the eyes of others who know you well enough to understand your life path so far.\n\nHave the courage to be honest about yourself. Don’t beat yourself up in the process, which is not useful. The concept of “brutal honesty” is just an excuse to be mean to people and put them down to make others feel better. So be gentle and honest – those are not mutually exclusive communication qualities.\n\nDo your best, be open and attempt to suspend self-judgment or aggrandizement in the process.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"2t31tve4SY0qCGqqMIQo0Q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T11:26:31.515Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-28T16:24:36.384Z","revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"4CDA0OrQsUESsyemQ4IUsQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:29:55.180Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:29:55.181Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"а1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/4CDA0OrQsUESsyemQ4IUsQ/ee04a2d0646ae01cc0d7ee86f595531e/__1.png","details":{"size":1945,"image":{"width":187,"height":202}},"fileName":"а1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"What are your __strengths__?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"3nMAagma7S2wau2GmGCUU2","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T11:27:15.489Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-24T19:20:40.404Z","revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"1HcGlEdMNqyMuoqSIIOGYu","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:38:51.477Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:38:51.477Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"a2","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/1HcGlEdMNqyMuoqSIIOGYu/dab4e22c40b2d199da05f5931e00498c/a2.png","details":{"size":1559,"image":{"width":104,"height":105}},"fileName":"a2.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"What are your __weaknesses__?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"F3mQrBUuIKkOSYGsQIgAo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T11:28:39.830Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-24T19:23:28.013Z","revision":5,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"2A51gd0KPCcAeOooooGkmg","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:39:09.228Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:39:09.228Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"a3","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/2A51gd0KPCcAeOooooGkmg/3ed23f0c5dfcf6e7d73b16f9e6de8624/a3.png","details":{"size":1629,"image":{"width":104,"height":105}},"fileName":"a3.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"What does a close friend or family member, an __objective__ one, think of your strengths and weaknesses?\n\n\n"}}],"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"200XAtk6640oiQskWW0qAA","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:21:01.811Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:21:01.811Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-3)","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/200XAtk6640oiQskWW0qAA/3e2d67c47d6cd21dbec7be54f01ffa3e/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-3_.svg","details":{"size":172132,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-3).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"type":"MEDITATION","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"What Are Your Strengths & Weaknesses?","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"68a76MNDUIsIOicWGcA8I4","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:21:16.736Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:21:16.736Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-3)","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/68a76MNDUIsIOicWGcA8I4/dc8f2b7237195466ecbf1dd1e8b49d25/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-3_.svg","details":{"size":172132,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-3).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"workbookDurationMin":15},"4":{"number":4,"title":"Who Is on My Board of Advisors?","subtitle":"Phase 1: Meditation","description":"This exercise begins the process of forming a Board of Advisors, either formally or informally.

Feedback and encouragement as we move along our life path is crucial.\n\nYou can learn a lot about yourself based on who you rely on and spend most of your time with. I’ve observed that many people do not have an effective and nurturing supporting cast. We go with the easy road, surrounding ourselves with familiar faces that were part of our lives from the start.

Do you not think about it much, just trying to make it through the days, taking things as they come? Or are you a go getter, a task master? In looking back at my goals over the years, I recognized the need for more classification, as there are vastly different types of goals. \n\nSome goals are very specific and tangible, while others are based more on feelings and dynamics between people. \n\nI broke down my Goals into 7 Types to gain clarity on what exactly I wanted to achieve. Read through them below and think about which ones are most relevant to you. \n\n1. Energy & Time (ET) Type– ET implies the process of setting and tracking goals through the filters of how you allocate time and energy.\n\n2. Achievements & Skills (AS) Type- \tBucket list tasks and experiences that you would like to accomplish, generally go in here. “I want to speak Span- ish fluently” or “I want to run a marathon”.\n\n3. Health Indicators (HI) Type-  Objectives related to bodily health.“I want to live and be healthy un- til 100” or “I want to quit smoking”. \n\n4. Internal Qualities (IQ) Type-  Objectives related to personality growth or motivation. Self-assessments can help identify attributes to work on.  “I want to be more confident.” \n\n5. Place & Environment (PE) Type- Objectives related to travel.“I want to take more vaca- tions this year.” or “I want to move to California within 5 years.”\n\n6. Material Outcomes (MO) Type- Ambitions related to money and possessions. “I want to have $1 million dol- lars.”  “I want to get buy a luxury car this year.”\n\n7. Relationship Quality Type- Ambitions related to personal relations.“I want to have a better relationship with my father.” or “I want to be regarded as a well- liked colleague at my company.”\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"7jWTamzRGoYKGosYgQC8yM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T13:44:47.452Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-25T19:55:47.608Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"content":"List  10 recent goals and classify them according to the 7 Goal Types."}}],"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"3yIAo9TD4IE06mwUcYg8ku","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:20:16.573Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:20:16.573Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-5)","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/3yIAo9TD4IE06mwUcYg8ku/3faa3b34ec7a4642658943f060ea506c/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-5_.svg","details":{"size":181509,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-5).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"type":"MEDITATION","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"The 7 Goal Types","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"16oW3ZpWDiE2kMc4G6soqO","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:19:57.005Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:19:57.005Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-5)","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/16oW3ZpWDiE2kMc4G6soqO/ca03d19a93254ecdbba07e5c5410772e/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-5_.svg","details":{"size":181509,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-5).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"workbookDurationMin":15},"6":{"number":6,"title":"The Goals of Others","subtitle":"Phase 1: Meditation","description":"Step outside of your own aspirations for a few moments, and genuinely direct your energy towards those around you, be it family, friends or colleagues at work or school. \n\nImagine that you have received feedback from your Board of Advisors.  Now it’s your turn to give, and possibly sit on some Boards for other CEO of Mes. What are their goals and dreams, and how can you play a small or large part in supporting them?\n\nWhile I am a big believer in individuality and self-determina- tion, the big picture puts into perspective the reality that we are all connected and impact each other in very direct and also in- credibly subtle ways. \n\nThis lesson is a call to action for you to open your mind and heart to this truth, and then commit it as a priority in your 20/20 Life Vision. I am sure that you are already doing things to help the goals of others and to help other people.  Some of us are guilty of doing “too much” for others at the expense of our own needs – which is the other end of the pendulum from selfishness, and equally unsustainable. \n\nThere has to be balance in the way you work for your goals versus those of others. Wherever you can find ways to share common goals with others, be it at work or with your family, incredible opportunities for power, human connection and collective achievement exist (e.g., think about a sports team winning a championship, and what the experience they shared, and the life long bonds created as a result).\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"2z9VyyIKfWAiEcCQwA6kiq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T13:47:02.004Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-26T12:59:09.487Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"5d1e5VVcZOAE4iUWkqMEI6","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-27T13:46:56.498Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-27T13:46:56.498Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"188233-numbers","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/5d1e5VVcZOAE4iUWkqMEI6/5d531680f3b0b2409c480dab9af0ba84/188233-numbers.png","details":{"size":3024,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"188233-numbers.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Choose 3 people who you really care about and write down 3-5 of their goals.

The 7 Goal Outcomes","subtitle":"Phase 1: Mediation","description":"This exercise focuses on what usually hap- pens to you after you set goals. Sit down, clear your mind, read this with focus, and answer the questions with clarity. Consider doing this with every exercise.\n\nDoesn’t Goal Setting make you feel inspired and energized? When we set goals, you’re right in that moment of vision. This is the fun part, where you can think freely and have no limits. What typically happens after you set goals however, does not oftentimes transpire the way you planned it. \n\nCheck out my Common Goal Outcomes (CGOs) below…\n\n__1. Bench Warmer__ -    The goal sits on the shelf (or the bench)…and collects dust. We avoid it or procrastinate it in any way possible.\n\n__2. Fast Starter__ -   The goal gets out of the gate quickly and enthusiastically, only to be forgotten because “Life got in the way.” Our drive (towards the goal) declines over time, until finally it fizzles out. \n\n__3. Breeze Through__-  “Crushed it!” Not only do you achieve the goal, but you blow it out of the water. It didn’t even require significant effort. Just a moment – was this a setup for an easy victory? If so, anything wrong with that?\n\n__4. (Self?) Sabotage__-    Everything is great, and you’re right on track to get it done. You want to win the race, and you’re winning by a mile. Then, at the last minute, all of a sudden, something happens, and you abort the mission. A “more important” priority came up – an exciting new opportunity, or maybe just a new distraction. Somehow, you lost total motivation in an instant, whether or not the sabotage was self-imposed or brought about by an external situation. \n\n__5. NFLOE (Not For Lack Of Effort)__-   You hustle, contribute sig- nificant energy, and fight all the way to the finish. The effort is there, but the results do not come through. It just wasn’t enough. You underestimated what it takes to achieve this goal. Use this as a lesson to inform your future goal setting.\n\n__6.  Right  On  Point__-  You  made  a  plan, followed through, and nailed it!\n\n__7. Latency Effect__-  The goal deadline ex- pires, you note either a “success” or “failure” and then suddenly, the outcome changes. That promotion that you worked so hard for, comes through! Conversely, your great achievement falls apart. Pay attention to these latent outcomes. It can be very positive for future goal-setting exercises. It might take longer than you think to receive a desired (or undesired) outcome.

It sounds more like a business term, but it is more relevant to the quality of our lives. Most people simply don’t have enough fuel to effectively pursue their goals and core responsibilities. Even if they do, they are depleted at the end of each day, and enter couch potato mode after getting home from work. \n\nHow often have you thought of or heard others say, “I don’t have the energy to workout. I’m too tired after work.”? The irony is that, although it takes an amount of energy to exercise, what one gets back from that experience is generally a multiple of what was invested.\n\nWhat are the two most powerful sources of “Internal Energy Production”? \n\n__1. Physical Exercise__-\nThere is all kinds of scientific and personal evidence that confirms how important physical exercise is to our moods and productivity. While most agree, it is typically motivation, prioritization or discipline factors that disrupt our best laid plans of integrating exercise into our lives.\n\n\n__2. Meditation__-\n\nBy meditation, I’m not talking about “meditating on ideas” but the act of using our breathe and body to relax, clear the mind and go deeper into our inner worlds. There are so many types and methods of meditation, which I will outline and recommend several practices over the coming exercises. Some people use music, lighting and/or aromas (e.g., incense, candles) to set the mood, while others use nature (outdoors). Prayer, depending on how it is done, is a powerful form of meditation. Everyone has to find what works for them.

What is your life’s purpose? Why have you come here, to Planet Earth, at this point in time, from this family and in this part of the world? With this 20/20 effort, one step at a time, you are creating and refining that vision.\n\nDuring Step 4, I introduced the concept of being the CEOofMe and building a Board of Advisors, a supporting, positive cast of friends, family, colleagues and mentors. Let’s now consider the influence of a different group – Role Models, Idols or Archetypes. The difference between role models and mentors is that role models can be people that you either don’t know personally, or that you do not have regular contact with. For example, kids idolize movie stars, athletes and celebrities, for various reasons, not all of which are long lasting or necessarily beneficial. Our (Western) society certainly puts a lot of unrealistic and fantastical ideas in our minds, through advertising and other unconscious forms of hero worship. Hopefully, as we grow older, we create more separation between fantasy and reality. Archetypes are role models who are not necessarily who we think they are – after all, how do we really know who someone is from a magazine or TV program?\n\nFrom where you stand today, who do you consider to be your role models? Hopefully, you have some direct contact with at least one or several people who you really look up to, and seek in some ways to emulate. I recommend identifying or finding at least one role model from your contacts, and then at least one who presents an ideal, that you do not personally know (e.g., maybe someone in your trade that has achieved success). Whose life looks good to you, not just in terms of what they may have materially, but in terms of their inner content, quality of their relationships and their aura – the energy that they give off? Our role models often change as we evolve, moving through different phases of our lives, and therefore, it is OK to “retire” role models, in favor of new ones.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"1952IDTfvmoOm22EygwWuW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T14:01:36.163Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-30T19:19:41.796Z","revision":7,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"content":"__Who are my current role models?__ \n\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"2OAKOx3M3CIsWc4EQ8SAGu","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T15:06:47.539Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-26T15:05:52.643Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"1GTJPcrawIQuGuu0g0ks6g","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-27T15:06:32.849Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-27T15:06:32.849Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"b","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/1GTJPcrawIQuGuu0g0ks6g/00f2e5d22923cf012c07c93d0815aeda/b.png","details":{"size":702,"image":{"width":37,"height":37}},"fileName":"b.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"What Life Category does he/she primarily influence?"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"7KXJWFIhQkUW8GQEi0MG0y","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-27T15:07:15.125Z","updatedAt":"2017-10-26T15:07:42.593Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"7kUlOoPStGuMsA2UcwSE6i","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-27T15:07:09.742Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-27T15:07:09.742Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"c","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/7kUlOoPStGuMsA2UcwSE6i/3d734e0f37125ced09e4e9c874a5c678/c.png","details":{"size":666,"image":{"width":36,"height":44}},"fileName":"c.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"To what degree do you know and interact with them personally?

Think beyond monetary, although money can be a good indicator of your growth.  Are you in the kind of role that allows your best characteristics to flourish? Or do you feel suppressed at work?

They provide the ultimate mirror, and opportunity to connect with a deeper part of ourselves. In the context of goals, just think about when you achieve something great – you generally want to share it with someone or several people who you are close with. It is also a vital Goal Dimension, I feel – Relationship Quality (RQ) – to our overall happiness in life. \n\nI’d like to introduce you to one of our relationship experts – Ron Baker – to guide this portion of your 20/20 journey. Ron is an insightful, compassionate and downright profound healer, therapist and guide to thousands of people, including myself, on a 1-1 basis as well as through his books and educational programs. It’s clear that Ron lives true to his purpose on the planet. Ron, welcome aboard and thank you for leading us through this most delicate topic.\n\n__RON BAKER__\n\n\"There is so much to say about relationships. It is hard to imagine breaking this topic down in a few paragraphs. Having done 25 years of work with thousands of people around the world, I am convinced that all of your relationships, including the most intimate partners in your lives, are reflections of the relationship you have with yourself.\n\nThe most basic determinant of the quality of your relationships is how safe you truly feel to give and receive in mutual value. Typically, when I ask my clients whether they feel safer to give OR receive, the vast majority of people say that they feel much safer giving.

Emotional health (step 16) and relationship to health (Step 17) are inexticably linked to your spiritual self or rather life philosophy.\n\nIn my view, Spirituality entails the following components, and addresses life’s most profound questions:\n__1. Purpose__-- Why am I here on Planet Earth? What is my purpose? \n__2.

This most important Vision Creation Phase is where you get to dream big and lay the foundation for a fulfilling and productive life.\nBack on Day 13, you were asked to assess the past 5 years of your work life, and essentially answer the question of how fulfilling your current career track has been over that time span. Today, we begin the first of 7 forward-looking Vision Creations, starting in this same area. The same question that I posed on Day 13 comes up again – “To what degree are you doing what you love?” Today, we flash forward to the Year 2020, and the answer is a resounding “YES!!” Now what needs to be done over the next 5 years in order for that statement to become a reality?\nI will tell you a little bit of my story here. I graduated from a great University (Columbia College, in New York City) back in 1996, where all major banks and consulting firms recruit top “talent” every year, giving them big salaries from the get go and putting them on the corporate “fast track” to success. It was the American Dream at work – to compete and be on top of the world, in the world’s finance capital, Wall Street! I did what everyone else was doing – setting up interviews and researching these companies, to make sure I could hold my own when they started drilling me with questions. The process felt like a scene from any of these big corporate power movies – The Devil’s Advocate, The Firm, Wall Street. I wasn’t feeling it. I did get offers though, and considered them. But what really inspired me was the start-up technology world. I wanted to be a major part of a small team that took risks to bring new, innovative products and services to life. I didn’t have any experience in this area, being a new graduate, but I felt inspired when I read and thought about entrepreneurship. I had an inkling of a vision for my career track, and it didn’t have big corporate \nWelcome to Day 23 of the 20/20 Life Vision Challenge!\noffices and a Wall Street lifestyle in it. Not that there is anything wrong with that – in fact, I have many friends that went on that track, and have done very well, financially and personally. It just wasn’t for me, and something inside my being knew it. So I took a chance by joining my friend, Charles Balsamo, at a small startup called Exeter Technologies. We were the Co-Founders – he was CEO and I was CFO, titles we knew little about, but grew into over the next three years. Actually, in a startup, you wear so many hats – I was doing all the Sales & Marketing, as well as some R&D, in addition to HR and Finances. It was the building of my foundation and experience in startup venture building – and I loved every minute of it, even the all-nighters, where we had to work around the clock to meet major deadlines. You see, when you really love what you do, it doesn’t feel like work. And that is what I have always sought after. 20 years later, I continue this journey, doing what I love every single day.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"3bSDKp2XkAmsUu0CIMUOyw","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-28T15:27:35.289Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-28T15:27:35.289Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"6bWYnmC9qgsgOy2AakWAis","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-28T15:27:30.778Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-28T15:27:30.778Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"c1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/6bWYnmC9qgsgOy2AakWAis/1d703b8d21f9b3c81f9e96516dc0b175/c1.png","details":{"size":2662,"image":{"width":199,"height":192}},"fileName":"c1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Check-In: Have you done your – (A) Mantra, (B) Exercise, and (C) Meditation yet today?

This is not just about how much you have or make – it is about how you think and feel about the world of things, and how skillfully you are able to operate in that world. We’ve all heard the phrase “More Money, More Problems”, a popular lament of the rich and famous, who oftentimes have difficulty with managing money. While we may idolize these celebrities for their stature and seeming access to the finer things in life, how come it seems that many of them are not all that happy? I believe it has to do with two main factors:\n\n__1__- Money may be nice to have, and can surely temporarily help you live a more comfortable and stress-free lifestyle (if managed well), but it does not bring long-lasting joy.\n\n__2__- The energy surrounding money and material things is overwhelming, and attracts many negative forces. Think about the entourages and all-of-a-sudden “friends” that wealthy athletes have after signing big contracts. Everyone lining up for the money train, including financial “advisors”, lawyers and others that “want to help”, causing confusion and These folks did not build a proper Board of Advisors \nYou don’t have to be multi-millionaire celebrities to experience these negative effects. The pure chase for money and things, as well as your insecurities over your financial status, can drain your vital energy, and sabotage positive traits. The trick is to build a positive relationship to the material world, and not let it take over our soul. \n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"IoMnVSu3cWO4YgAoaE8mC","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:59:58.773Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:59:58.773Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"5ZnVkVFy0gMGqgGAYIUGE","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:59:54.468Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:59:54.468Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"vc1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/5ZnVkVFy0gMGqgGAYIUGE/aaeec75bd9d4d788b26f24f5493fec63/vc1.png","details":{"size":1137,"image":{"width":100,"height":102}},"fileName":"vc1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"__Check-In__\nHave you done your – (A) Mantra, (B) Exercise, and (C) Meditation yet today?

It’s David Owens from Step 16. This current Step is usually where you begin to bump up against some of the internal (e.g., inner negative voices) and external (e.g., finding time) obstacles that can prevent you from reaching your goals.  The good news is that, with persistence and creativity all the goals you seek to achieve can be accomplished. You have to be honest and fair though as well. \n \nFor example, if you’ve never run long distance in your life, you are potentially setting yourself up for failure if you aspire to run a marathon in one month, and do so in under 3 hours. Set goals that will inspire you to stretch yet that are also within your grasp, and not so challenging that you become discouraged. Also, don’t be afraid to try new things (other than a gym workout) that better fit your persona.  Try tai chi, yoga, Gyrotonic or swimming. \n\nRemember the basics: \n\n__Nutrition and Diet__\n\nThough it is cliché – you are what you eat. Being active is very important; but what you eat, the quality of the food, and the quantity are factors if not taken into consideration, can undo all of the hard work you put in. If you don’t like to cook, consider looking into food companies that make healthy prepackaged meals. If you like to cook or want to learn a new skill, the culinary arts are wide open for exploration.\n\n__Sleep__\n\nSleep hygiene is such a highly under-appreciated component to your health and well-being. Everyone has different requirements for the amount of sleep they need to operate at an optimal level, but the quality of the sleep is just as important. If you consistently need coffee or other stimulants to make it through the day, you’re not getting enough quality sleep. Try out a sleep ritual to help to slumber off. \n\n__Body Care__\n\nJust like a car, your body needs maintenance and check-ups (not necessarily of the medical doctor kind). Massage, acupuncture and chiropractic adjustments are some of the more pop- ular alternative means of self-care.\n\n__Mental and Emotional Health__\n\nAs a complex being, your mental and emotional health are key components to your physical health. Make sure you have someone to talk to, whether it’s a friend or a professional. We need to be heard and understood. \n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"32poCqwtAcEIQOEK8qi2qo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-09-29T11:41:02.717Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-14T14:58:12.471Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"6EQz9t1LtSQS0iOEg6kmSo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T11:40:41.850Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T11:40:41.850Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"vc2","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/1gbed7lrsmj4/6EQz9t1LtSQS0iOEg6kmSo/0acaf6749e227ebbccf61ec89efb549b/vc2.png","details":{"size":1560,"image":{"width":100,"height":102}},"fileName":"vc2.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"__Your 20/20 Health Goals & Dreams__\nImagine yourself 5 years from now.

The deeper you go, the more your goals will fall into alignment with the Master plan.\n\nRemember your Board of Advisors, first introduced on Step 4? Good mentors tend to bring everything back to your life purpose and inner journey. There is so much controversy and differences of opinion regarding spiritual philosophy. There are also  a lot of pretenders and predators who don’t have either real knowledge or good intentions, but who prey off of others who are authentically eager and open to guidance. Follow your heart and intuition when it comes to aligning with any type of spiritual teacher or guide.\n\nToday, in building on the mentorship concept, I want to encourage you to consider what other types of support structures you have in your life. It’s not all about having a be-all, end-all mentor, which is not easy to find. \n\nSometimes, having peers, who are at or around your same level, can be as helpful as having a mentor; because those people are going through the same challenges as you are can relate.  Ideally, you would have both – guidance from those who have walked in your shoes and moved further along the path, as well as those who are walking the walk, right by your side. Be it a formal support group, or informal group of friends, you really need this type of support . \nWithout these support networks, its easier to fall back on bad habits, loneliness, depression and other “negative” emotions.

Think about each hour you have spent on your 20/20\nLife Vision as a seed – an idea – that can either grow and bear fruit or stagnate and die. \n\nYou will have 43,848 hours over 1,827 days over the next 5 years to evolve and manifest your dreams. The focus now is on building a detailed time and energy allocation plan for the 366 days Every hour, every minute, every second counts.\n\nWith your dreams as guidance and inspiration (Step 22), it is now \ntime to get specific. Think of each of those 43,848 hours as a grain of sand in the hourglass of your life. The grains will pass through the fulcrum whether you plan them or not. Make each grain count.\n\nOn Step 10, you mapped out your Internal World. Again, I stress the importance of becoming the master or CEO of your internal world, which surely faces hundreds of competing demands. Everyone and everything wants your time and have promises or reasons for why you should spend more time with them. I am asking for some of it here, to participate in this program. Your family wants more of it. Your work and boss want more from you. Community service wants it. The Church wants it. It’s endless. You cannot make everyone totally happy. Wrestle with these competing demands and be firm about what your priorities are.
