I am Arman, and I will be your guide. Let’s start with a __5 minute meditation__ called ‘The Rocking Chair’. Get comfortable, put your cell phone on silent, turn off the TV and dim the lights. Put on some soft music if that helps you with this visualization exercise.\n\nReady? Now picture yourself in this __rocking chair__, at 90 years old. You are with your grand children, reflecting back on your life. Hear the waves softly coming to the shore, as you watch the sun gracefully setting in the distance. Your grand kids want to know about your life. What will you share with them? Keep your eyes closed and meditate on this deeply – your life, what it has been, and how you will tell this story to the next generation.\n\nOK, now come back to the present day – December 2, 2015 (or whenever you read this) – and feel who you are right now, in relation to that 90 year old man or woman whose eyes you just saw the world through for the last 5 minutes.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"38iymD0qlysIe2k8EU2Uyc","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:34.779Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:34.779Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"62YTJht7Wg8miG0wo2cEY0","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:25.185Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:25.185Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"day_1_step_1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/62YTJht7Wg8miG0wo2cEY0/fe1540d7e48abba39d38e0713cda3db1/2017-09-14_16-46-26.png","details":{"size":12507,"image":{"width":200,"height":200}},"fileName":"2017-09-14_16-46-26.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Write down your __best memories __(at least 3), __regrets__ (up to 3) and __defining moments__ (at least 3).

If you did, I am sure that it prompted some deep reflection on your life path. Today, we are continuing to meditate, moving now to a more specific and immediate area of your life, life categories.\nWhat if you could wake up next week and spend your time doing whatever you really want to do? Think about your life right now, and what typical weekdays and weekends are like. How would you break down your life, in terms of categories; and then, estimate how much time you spend on each area in a given week – 168 hours? What specifically would you like to do more of? Less of? Who would you like to spend more time with? Less time with? Where would you like to spend more time, and less time? Imagine that next week, anything is possible.\nI am a proponent of having people create their own Life Categories, and using whatever naming conventions they prefer; however, in the end, it all really maps to the same core activities. Sleep is sleep, work is work, etc. As for me, I break my life, at this current era, down into 7 main categories and 40 or so sub-areas within those 7 categories. I call those sub-areas “bugs”, which is where the concept for Timebug was born. You can use my Life Categories (listed below, with an example of the weekly time allocation) or something that better fits how you think about and manage your life.\n__MY CURRENT WEEK__\n- Spirituality [13h] \n- Core Work [28h]\n- Special Projects (also Work, but for me, more exciting, exploratory ventures like the creation of 7 Pillars and Timebug!)

We really want to hone in on what has been holding you back from your full potential. As we all know, our vices can completely disrupt and ruin otherwise happy and fruitful lives. Now isn’t the time to focus only on the positive and brush those character flaws under the rug. On the other hand, it is also quite rare to witness people living at their full potential; but when you do come across those who are at or close to that level, you can feel them beaming with energy, and see how happy they are. Do you know someone like that? If so, take note – in future lessons, we will focus on identifying and connecting with role models and mentors.\nIn the movie, Lucy, Morgan Freeman gives a great lecture about what might happen if human beings start using more than 10% of our brains; I definitely recommend watching it. Freeman notes “One hundred billion neurons per human of which only fifteen percent are activated. There are more connections in the human body than there are stars in the galaxy. We possess a gigantic network of information to which we have almost no access.”\nCan you be objective about your own strengths and weaknesses? Objectivity is one of the cornerstones of wisdom and maturity; and it is one of the most difficult qualities to possess, because it requires us to see ourselves clearly, without bias and judgment – not an easy task. Do your best, be open and attempt to suspend self-judgment or aggrandizement in the process.\nIt is also important to observe how others think of you. What kind of impression do you make on people (not just the first impression, but over time); and who knows you well enough to understand why your life path has unfolded this way so far? It is a special opportunity to see yourself through the eyes of others – like a mirror, such as parents or close friends, especially during periods of personal growth and in cases where they have enough content to be clean mirrors for you.","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"2t31tve4SY0qCGqqMIQo0Q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:27.426Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:27.426Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Asset","id":"2HRH8dX5e0qosGgc2gmwUA"}},"content":"Meditate on who you are today, and how you got to this point in your life – thinking of the good things that you possess and have experienced.

It also suggested feedback from a third party – be it a family member, close friend or objective outsider (ie. a therapist, life coach, etc).\nIn the CEO of Me concept, I recommend forming a Board of Advisors or Directors, either formally or informally. Today (Day 4) we begin that process, as we go beyond ourselves and own ideas, bringing in others who know us well, that are actively part of our lives, and give feedback and encouragement as we move along our life path.\nYou can learn a lot about someone based on who they rely on and spend most of their time with. From my observation, many of us do not have an effective and nurturing supporting cast. We go with the easy road, surrounding ourselves with familiar faces that were part of our lives all along. Some are lucky enough to have at least one strong role model, maybe a parent or a friend, who is capable of collaborating on life’s trials and giving guidance. With a little bit of effort, we can find new people or revive old relationships that are positive influences.

The 7 Goal Types","subtitle":"Welcome to Day 5 of the 20/20 Life Vision Challenge! Life Goals","description":"What kind of attitude and approach do you have towards goal-setting and life goals? Do you not think about it much, just trying to make it through the days, or taking things as they come? Or are you a go getter and a task master? In looking back at my own goals over the years, I recognized the need for more classification, as there were vastly different types of goals; some goals are very specific and tangible, while others are based more on feelings and dynamics between people. This breakdown of the 7 Goal Types gave me more clarity on what exactly I wanted to achieve. I hope that it will do the same for you on your journey.\nSo here are the 7 Types of Goals. As you read through them, think about which ones are most relevant to you.\n__1. ET Type__ – Energy & Time allocation. ET implies the process of setting and tracking goals through the filters of how we allocate our time and energy. \n__2. AS Type__ – Achievements & Skills. “I want to speak Spanish fluently” or “I want to run a marathon”. Things from your bucket list, and experiences that you would like to have, generally go in here.\n__3. HI Type__ – Health Indicators. “I want to live and be healthy until 100.” or “I want to quit smoking”. Anything to do with our own bodily health.\n__4. IQ Type__ – Internal Qualities. “I want to be more confident.” (While this is subjective, we can use a scale to measure this self-assessment) \n__5. PE Type__ – Place & Environment. “I want to take more vacations this year.” or “I want to move to California within 5 years.”\n__6. MO Type__ – Material Outcomes. “I want to have $1 million dollars.” Or “I want to get six pack abs this year.” \n__7. RQ Type__ – Relationship Quality. “I want to have a better relationship with my father.” or “I want to be regarded as a wellliked colleague at my company.”\nThe distinctions of these 7 Goal Types are important because the approaches to attaining each Goal Type vary, and some, for example Material Outcomes, are often not under our direct control. The Types are ordered actually, from what is most under our control to what is least under our control. I encourage people to have all seven goal types, but to separate them out in order to have some clarity. There will be overlap, where certain goals fit into different types; in that case, I recommend assigning one as the primary type, and any others as secondary.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"7jWTamzRGoYKGosYgQC8yM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:21.707Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:21.707Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"content":"List out at least 10 of your recent goals (2015 annual goals would be ideal).

The Goals of Others","description":"Today, we look at the goals of others. If you’re jumping in here, I highly recommend going back and starting from Day 1, going through the program sequentially. If you’re feeling behind or “missed” a day, don’t fret – just carve out that 15-30 minutes, and restart from wherever you left off. Can you play catch up and do 2 or 3 a days? That is up to you, but I generally recommend against that. There is a science behind the 30 day cycle. It is like building a muscle, through incremental, consistent efforts. Another analogy is that of food and digestion. This is 30-40 days worth of food. You simply cannot eat it all at once!\nToday, we are called upon to step outside of our own aspirations for a few moments, and genuinely direct our energy towards those around us, be it family, friends or colleagues at work or school. This is the other side of the Board of Advisors concept, where you received support from others. Now it’s your turn to give, and possibly sit on some Boards for other CEOofMes. What are their goals and dreams, and how can you play a small or large part in supporting them? In 2012, I wrote a blog titled “How the Successes and Failures of Others Impact You” – it’s a quick read, take a look.\nWhile I am a big believer in our individuality and self-determination, the big picture puts into perspective the reality that we are all connected and impact each other in very direct and also incredibly subtle ways. Today’s lesson is a call to action for us to open our minds and hearts to this truth, and then ensure that it is a priority within our 20/20 Life Vision. I am sure that you are already doing plenty of things to help the goals of others and to help other people; some of us are guilty of doing “too much” for others at the expense of our own needs – which is the other end of the pendulum from selfishness, and equally unsustainable. There has to be balance in the way we work for our own goals versus those of others. Wherever you can find ways to share common goals with others, be it at work or with your family, incredible opportunities for power, human connection and collective achievement exist (ie. think about a sports team winning a championship, and what the experience that they shared, and life long bonds created as a result).","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"2z9VyyIKfWAiEcCQwA6kiq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:20.189Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:20.189Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"5d1e5VVcZOAE4iUWkqMEI6","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:11.586Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:11.586Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"188233-numbers","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/5d1e5VVcZOAE4iUWkqMEI6/c13397274529ca717c374e79d995849e/188233-numbers.png","details":{"size":3024,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"188233-numbers.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Choose 3 people in your life, who you really care about and feel that you can be a great source of support for.

Today’s meditation is a reflection on what usually happens to us after we set goals. Sit down, and clear your mind, so that you can read this with focus, and answer the assignment questions with clarity.\nBy the way, it is highly recommended that you exercise every day while you are doing this challenge.\nGoal Setting feels great, doesn’t it? When we set goals, we’re right in that moment of vision and inspiration. This is the fun part, where we can think freely and have no limits. What typically happens after we set goals however, does not always transpire the way we planned it, does it?\nThere are several Common Goal Outcomes (CGOs), which I have playfully named and outlined below:\n__1. Bench Warmer.__ The goal sits on the shelf (or the bench)…and collects dust. We avoid it or procrastinate it in any way possible.\n__2. Fast Starter.__ We get out of the gate quickly and enthusiastically, only to see our drive (towards the goal) decline over time, until finally it fizzles out. Or we use the old “Life got in the way” rationale to justify giving up on it. \n__3. Breeze Through.__ “Crushed it!” Not only do you achieve the goal, but you blow it out of the water. This wasn’t even close. And it didn’t even require significant effort. Just a moment – was this a setup for an easy victory? If so, anything wrong with that?\n__4. (Self?) Sabotage.__ Everything is going great, and you’re right on track to get it done. You wanted to win the race, and you’re winning by a mile. Then, at the last minute, all of a sudden, something happens, and you abort the mission. A “more important” priority came up – an exciting new opportunity, or maybe just a new distraction. Somehow, you lost total motivation in an instant, whether or not the sabotage was self-imposed or brought about by an external situation. “Life just got in the way” works well here (as a common excuse) also. \n__5. NFLOE = Not For Lack Of Effort.__ You hustled and put in significant energy, and fought all the way to the finish. The effort was there, but the results did not come through as specified by the goal (i.e. “Win a championship” or “Lose 25 pounds.”) It just wasn’t enough. Maybe you underestimated what it would take to achieve this goal; but at least now, if you take a technical approach, you have the experience and learnings to inform your goal-setting for next time around. \n__6. Right On Point.__ You charted out a plan, and followed through. You nailed it! \n__7. Latency Effect.__ For Outcomes 5 & 6 above, there is something interesting that can happen after the goal deadline expires. After you put the result in the books – as a “success” or “failure”, something happens, and the outcome changes. All of a sudden, that promotion that you worked so hard for, comes through! Or conversely, your nice achievement, after initial success, falls apart. This can be very positive, and if one pays attention, good for future goal-setting skill, as you get a better feeling for how long it may take to achieve certain goals (which is usually longer than we think!)\nAs you go about a new round of annual and 5-year contemplation, on your life and how it progressed (or not) along the desired path from 2011-2015, consider bucketing your goals into these 7 Outcome categories. See any patterns? Keep this in mind when mapping your #2020life.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"5Qg4R96Gju2YiykEs0c8Q","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:16.774Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:16.774Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"4QT3IFdts4ieMcQkAo0yAs","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:07.460Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:07.460Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"188233-numbers","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/4QT3IFdts4ieMcQkAo0yAs/d9525240a8eefa493a16c7fd179b1ddf/188233-numbers.png","details":{"size":3024,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"188233-numbers.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"List out 10-15 goals of yours from a recent period, preferably 2011-2016; consider using the ones that you listed in the Day 5 \nAssignment on the 7 Goal Types.\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"3jdHt8b9yU6aKcMcM42Wau","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:15.946Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:15.946Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"3shjRSS796UAWEmW6aSOWY","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:06.709Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:06.709Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"a2","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/3shjRSS796UAWEmW6aSOWY/41e3626d69e64b05ac48dddde608fa09/a2.png","details":{"size":3629,"image":{"width":199,"height":148}},"fileName":"a2.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Classify what happened to each of them, across the 7 Common Goal Outcomes (CGOs) noted above."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"47lec8TOpqOSkAUUaq2aSM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:15.126Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:15.126Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"4AqsoAmn1KQqacQC06QKw8","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:05.955Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:05.955Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"a3","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/4AqsoAmn1KQqacQC06QKw8/79c6260e1046c6a45a1d8f4d6498406b/a3.png","details":{"size":3823,"image":{"width":175,"height":169}},"fileName":"a3.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Write down a few observations about any patterns that emerge, and what you believe is behind them.\n"}}],"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"86r3GLU67CMECMYgUEgcE","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:04.985Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:04.985Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"7","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/86r3GLU67CMECMYgUEgcE/c6e6f684854e2bc2bc1eefffc1ac6db5/7.png","details":{"size":15704,"image":{"width":259,"height":263}},"fileName":"7.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"type":"MEDITATION","color":"blue","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"What Happens After We Set Goals?","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"dsclpede0gYeU4KMaAGWo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:04.287Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:04.287Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"7","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/dsclpede0gYeU4KMaAGWo/2f56576b6b55819732a77fa7c58dc538/7.png","details":{"size":11968,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"7.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}},"8":{"number":8,"title":"Internal Energy Production","subtitle":"Welcome to Day 8 of the 20/20 Life Vision Challenge!","description":"Before we talk about internal energy production, if you’ve made it this far without missing a lesson, congratulations – you’re building a solid foundation for a clear and powerful life vision. Otherwise, it’s never too late to go back to Day 7 or earlier days, and fill in the gaps.\nToday’s lesson is about taking stock of your own energy levels, at different times of the day and week; then connecting that back to your daily routines for what I call “Internal Energy Production”. It sounds more like a business term, but it is even more relevant to the quality of our lives. Most people simply don’t have enough fuel to follow through effectively on their goals and core responsibilities; or even if they do, they are depleted at the end of each day, going into couch potato mode after getting home from work. How often have you thought of or heard others say “I don’t have the energy to workout. I’m too tired after work.” The irony is that, although it does take an amount of energy to exercise, what one gets back from that experience is generally a multiple of what was invested.\nWhy “Internal Energy Production” – that is because there are other sources of Energy Production, such as food, which we will discuss in later chapters; external sources of energy are a vitally important part of our life equation. However, the advantage of internal sources is that we don’t necessarily need much from outside of ourselves to create the resulting energy.\nI call your attention to the two most powerful sources of internal energy production available to us all, from my experience.\n__Physical Exercise__\n__Meditation__\nBy meditation, we’re not talking about “meditating on ideas” but the act of using our breathe and body to relax, clear the mind and go deeper into our inner worlds. There are so many types and methods of meditation, which I will outline and recommend several practices over the coming days. Some people use music, lighting and/or aromas (ie. incense, candles) to set the mood, while others use nature (outdoors). Prayer, depending on how it is done, is a powerful form of meditation. Everyone has to find what works for them. The question for you is whether you make time for it in your current schedule, and whether or not you comprehend the connection between this practice and the quality of your health and life.\nWhen it comes to exercise, I think that we’re dealing with a more concrete, known entity, with all kinds of scientific and personal evidence, that confirms how important it is to our moods and productivity. While most agree on those benefits, it is typically motivation, prioritization or discipline factors that disrupt our best laid plans of integrating exercise into our lives.\nMy challenge to you for the remainder of the 20/20 program is to make the time in your week to – (1) Exercise daily for at least 15 minutes; and (2) Meditate daily for at least 5 minutes. You can naturally do more if you have the time, but using this minimum threshold of 20 minutes in total gives you no excuses. If you miss a day here or there, nobody is going to scold you for it – it’s your life at the end of the day, and this is for your own benefit. My promise to you is that this effort will bring greater clarity and compactness to your 20/20 Life Vision. That is what happens when we are more relaxed and have our bodies flowing with energy.","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"5l43BYnThKkaGc4yccAici","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:14.306Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:14.306Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"2CfRTPilI0SW4C0oWsks6G","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:03.558Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:52:03.558Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"188233-numbers","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/2CfRTPilI0SW4C0oWsks6G/db127624afe7aed991a1d93d6d2f1773/188233-numbers.png","details":{"size":3024,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"188233-numbers.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"On a 1-10 scale, write down your Physical, Mental and Emotional energy levels during different times of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) on a typical Weekday and Weekend.

What is your life’s purpose? Why have you come here, to Planet Earth, at this point in time, from this family and in this part of the world? With a micro-effort, of 30 minutes a day, one step at a time, you are creating and refining that vision.\nBack on Day 4, I introduced the concept of being the CEOofMe and building your Board of Advisors, a supporting cast of friends, family, colleagues and mentors, who you feel can and do positively support you in your journey. Today, we bring a different angle to the influence of others – Role Models, Idols or Archetypes. The difference between role models and mentors is that role models can be people that you either don’t know personally, or that you do not have regular contact with. For example, when we are kids, we idolize movie stars, athletes and celebrities, for various reasons, not all of which are long lasting or necessarily beneficial. Our (Western) society certainly puts a lot of unrealistic and fantastical ideas in our minds, through advertising and other subconscious forms of hero worship. Hopefully, as we grow older, we are creating more separation between those fantasies and the realities of life. We use the word archetype, because sometimes those role models may not necessarily be who we think they are – after all, do we really know who someone is that we may read about or see on TV, or is it the idea of them that we look up to?\nFrom where you stand today, who do you consider to be your role models? Hopefully, you have some direct contact with at least one or several people who you really look up to, and seek in some ways to emulate. I do recommend identifying or finding at least one role model from your contacts; and then also having at least one who presents an ideal, that you do not personally know (ie. maybe someone in your trade that has achieved success). Whose life looks good to you, not just in terms of what they may have materially, but in terms of their inner content, quality of their relationships and their aura – the energy that they give off? Our role models often change as we evolve, moving through different phases of our lives; and therefore, it is OK to “retire” role models, in favor of new ones.\nAs you get your 20/20 Life Vision in motion, you will need plenty of fuel via inspiration from those who you look up to. Today is the day that you give your role models a place in your arsenal, on your #2020Life Team.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"1952IDTfvmoOm22EygwWuW","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:11.234Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:11.234Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"content":"Using the 20/20 Life Vision Day 9 Worksheet, answer the following question.\n__Who are your current role models?__\n"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"3LwDVCcs2QWs6yoaamwO08","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:10.486Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:10.486Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"C5odMi2dckSWoI8ag4umw","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:58.916Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:58.916Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"а","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/C5odMi2dckSWoI8ag4umw/fbc2e08a01cb64ee92a9300e45e42cd2/_.png","details":{"size":825,"image":{"width":34,"height":30}},"fileName":"а.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"\nList anywhere from 2-10.

How do we become more aware of these voices, some of which are so subtle yet influential, that we don’t even hear them – we just act upon their suggestions. Here is where we start to explore the deeper psychology behind our personalities, both conscious and unconscious.\nEach of us has a diverse internal world, rich with varying emotions, thoughts and behavior patterns. While we do change, hopefully for the better, over time, many of our patterns are sticky and continue manifesting over time, possibly taking slightly different new forms. In order to develop and then go out and attain any type of meaningful life vision, it is imperative to “Know Thyself” as intimately as possible – or should I say, “Know Thyselves”? Just like any community or family has multiple personalities and voices, that oftentimes want different things, each of us has different aspects of ego-personality within – let’s call those different “I’s”, as in “Greedy I”, “Generous I”, “Lazy I”, “Motivated I”, “Obsessive I”, “Calm I”, etc. How well coordinated and integrated those different I’s are, to a large extent, determines how much energy we have, how successful we are in our endeavors, and how good we feel overall. You literally have to develop internal leadership skills and claim your rightful place as the CEO of Me, with the understanding that your internal company called “Me” actually consists of hundreds of different “I’s” that all want to be the boss or just do their own thing without accountability to the collective “Me”. This is where self-sabotage comes from. Just on the day when you have that big presentation at work or school, that you worked so hard to prepare for, one of your I’s decides to throw a tantrum, gets really nervous or oversleeps, throwing off your flow. I’m sure that each of us can come up with plenty of examples, both positive and negative, of how our internal order or chaos directly influenced our outcomes.\nThinking about your internal world like it is that company or even a country called “Me” (or whatever you want to name it – your own name, or for the sake of this exercise, come up with a name). On Day 3, you created a list of Strengths & Weaknesses; reflect on that list, which will relate directly to what we are embarking on today, a deeper dive into knowing thyself, which will help you understand what internal processes and negotiations are manifesting in those qualities that show up externally as strengths and weaknesses. Making this connection is vital towards the overall aim here of discovering and harmonizing with your life’s purpose.","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"2EbLzd1P6kSiskmUOGMQ4I","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:06.962Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:54:06.962Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"6O3FhMsASIEMQks2qmEW6A","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:54.203Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:54.203Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"188233-numbers","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/6O3FhMsASIEMQks2qmEW6A/1230826b86924ed3e3781e66c4a5861a/188233-numbers.png","details":{"size":3024,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"188233-numbers.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Today, we wrap up Phase 1 of 3 10-day phases; tomorrow, we will recap what we learned (about ourselves) in Phase 1, and then move onto the Self-Assessment Phase, with an honest look back at who we have been and what we have achieved over the past 5 years.\nBack on Day 8, I prescribed two important daily practices – Exercise and Meditation – for building up positive energy, that can help you discover and clarify your vision.

If you are here, having completed all 10 lessons from Phase 1 [The Meditation & Discovery Phase], I commend you, for having created a solid base from which a powerful (rest of) Life Vision may be born. Today, we move into Phase 2, which is the Assessment Phase, where you look back on the most recent period of your life, to objectively review what was achieved, where you struggled and what your current status is as a result.\nAs 2015 comes to a close, we have a unique opportunity to assess the last five years of our lives (2011-2015) on a mid-decade cycle. I have been doing very detailed goal-setting and annual planning since I was 19 years old, and it has been one of the most challenging and rewarding tasks that I have taken on in my now 41 year-old lifetime. It is very difficult to see into the future and lay out long-term plans amidst what seems like a very unpredictable world. My own goals and aspirations have often been very far off from the reality that came to be – but not all of them. I have also tasted the fruits of achievements that I know would not have been possible without a strong vision, intention and commitment being directed towards those aims. Over 20 years of goal-setting, annual reviews and iterations into new years, I have learned how to be more realistic about what it takes to progress towards my goals, and recognized what skills I needed to acquire in order to be more productive along the way, all without compromising the grandiosity of my aspirations. I still shoot for the stars, and so can you.\nSo over the next 10 days, you will be asked to honestly assess all the important areas of your life and character, from Health to Relationships to Finances. This is a comprehensive program, and I know that it is not easy for us to look at ourselves in the mirror from all of these different angles; but it is necessary if we want to have a rich and satisfying experience while productively marching forth towards our dreams. The journey is just as, if not more important, than the destination. We start here with the 5 Year Report. Today’s task, which you may have to continue refining over the whole of Phase 2, revolves around gathering up and describing all of your data, ideas and results over the past five years. You may surprise yourself with how far you have come during this process; if not, no worries – it’s only half-time (in terms of the decade), and you have another entire 5 years in order to make some serious moves.

If you have been following the entire program sequentially, I am sure you can tell by now how every day’s lesson builds on top of the previous ones. That is why it is essential to complete each assignment – as you will be working with and refining your notes from prior days. Being in the Self-Assessment Phase now, we will be delving deeper into some of the brainstorming notes that you took during the Meditation & Discovery Phase. Let’s do a brief recap.\nBack on__ Day 1__ when we did the Rocking Chair meditation, you were asked to review your best life memories, regrets and defining moments from the standpoint of your future (90 year-old) self; that could have entailed current stories that you have already experienced, as well as future imagined possibilities from your upcoming years. \nOn __Day 2__, you estimated your current – versus ideal – weekly time allocation across the same 168 hours that every human being on Earth has to work with.\n__Day 3__ dealt with your Strengths & Weaknesses, and tied them to specific goals attained or not. \n__Day 4__ was about your supporting cast, the people that help you in various aspects of your life; which may also have brought up some gaps, where you can use more support going forward. \n__Day 5__ introduced the 7 Goal Types, and for the first time, asked you to list out 10+ goals that you have had over the past 5 years, segmenting them by Type. \n__Day 6__ challenged you to get outside of your own box and consider the Goals of Others, and how you can help them succeed. __Day 7__ mapped out the most typical paths that goals take after we set them. \n__Day 8__ raised vital questions about how you go about producing energy every day, suggesting meditation and exercise as imperative requirements for a healthy, happy and successful life. \n__Day 9__ prompted you to think about your role models, those who you aspire to be like and can learn from. \n__Day 10__, the last of Phase 1, dealt with our various personality traits (or I’s), and how they typically create internal conflict that prevents us from moving forward in an internally unified way, towards our goals and life purpose.\n__Day 11__, the first of Phase 2, got you started on assessing the past 5 years of your life. It is a big assignment, and will take different forms over the whole 10 days of Phase 2. Today, we are simply adding a few new wrinkles, to stimulate further thinking. Think about what the Major Life Events (MLEs) and defining moments have been for you over the past 5 years. It is the same as the Day 1 exercise, except focused on a 5-year period, rather than 90 years of your life! Here are some MLEs to consider – this is not a full list, and ultimately, what constitutes an MLE for you is somewhat subjective:\n- You got married…\n- Got divorced…\n- Had a child…\n- Graduated from school…\n- Dropped out of school…\n- Got a new job…\n- Got fired from your job…\n- Moved to a new country or city…\n- Had a major injury or surgery…\n- Had a loss of life among your family and friends…\n- Sold a company…\n- Started a company…\nMLEs specify what happened, whereas Defining Moments determine how you process what happens – what is your internal and external response? How did these MLEs, or even non-major events move you to reconsider your approach to an area of life? Nothing actually has to happen externally, to prompt an inner change of perspective. When MLEs occur, it also typically shifts your Energy & Time allocation (ET Type – from Day 5, remember?) dramatically (ie. for example, I had my first child – a son – in 2015, and had to make some major scheduling and planning shifts to make time for him!)\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"1anVzlnhsoUIsGGikEgMYM","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:59.505Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:59.505Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"6xWsFuI0pOaGQi8MYGGE2I","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:43.914Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:43.914Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"b1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/6xWsFuI0pOaGQi8MYGGE2I/a2ab948ae7529e1707e23eaeb09f56f1/b1.png","details":{"size":2462,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"b1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Specify what MLEs took place over the past 5 years, and working with your Day 2 Worksheet, specify how your time was generally shifted as a result."}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"5Oxb8BjmLKYqie8YsogSyY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:58.647Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:58.647Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"1prjSWi7BCcY4QUMEksgM8","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:43.222Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:43.222Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"b2","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/1prjSWi7BCcY4QUMEksgM8/e68710028ac49fb861091ee14f119667/b2.png","details":{"size":2764,"image":{"width":199,"height":159}},"fileName":"b2.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Building on or refining Question 1 from Day 11, how did those MLEs factor in – positively and negatively – to your goals over the past 5 years?

Career Assessment (Today, Day 13)\n2. Financial Assessment\n3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment\n4. Health Assessment\n5. Relationship Assessment\n6. Place & Environment Assessment\n7. Spirituality Assessment\nReflecting back on Day 4 (Supporting Cast or Board of Advisors – BOA) and Day 9 (Role Models), prepare to reach out to your cast this week, in order to get some feedback, which will help you complete the assessments. Ideally, you would have at least one person, a mentor or peer, to check-in with for each of the 7 assessments outlined above, starting with today’s focus – your Career Assessment. It is alright to have the same person from your BOA in different areas, if you trust them to that degree.\nWhen it comes to career, the key question that I ask is this – “To what degree are you doing what you love?” – to which I typically get one of several answers – “I am not sure what I love to do when it comes to work” or “That’s not realistic. I work to make money.” or “Kind of. I wanted to pursue this track, and I’m doing it. I’m sorta happy with it.” None of those answers are all that inspiring, but they reflect where most people – I would say 90% – are at in relation to their jobs. So what do the other 10% – the ones who are living their dreams – know that the 90% does not? They are purpose-driven people, who have a firm belief that we are all endowed with certain gifts and skills for a reason; that if we put our energy into finding and pursuing that reason, that is the extent to which our work life is fulfilling. If you are in the 90% or unsure, that is understandable, and you can still find a modicum of satisfaction and be successful from there. Maybe your career is not the area of your life from which you look to draw energy and inspiration. But if it is important to you, and you are not feeling satisfied, then a big percentage of your life force is being misdirected every week, and that impacts all other areas of your life.\nThink back on the past 5 years, and what type of professional growth you experienced. This is beyond monetary, although money can be a good indicator of your growth; therefore, feel free to use it as such. Are you in the kind of role that allows your best characteristics to flourish? Or do you feel suppressed at work? Are there a handful of new skills that you have attained over this period? How much do you enjoy going to work every day? These questions and more, form the basis of today’s assignment.\n\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"2zecTEsmzSc0oCe0UcAuoE","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:57.664Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:57.664Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"2RcwiCRcI8Q4kIqWoCWQGy","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:41.078Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:41.078Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"b1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/2RcwiCRcI8Q4kIqWoCWQGy/03bdb473e1d560bdd988d15478ab6045/b1.png","details":{"size":2462,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"b1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"- How has your salary grown (or not) from Jan 2011 to Dec 2015 (5 full years)?

The overview of 7 assessments is below, illustrating what is completed, where we are today, and what is to come in the following days:\n1. Career Assessment (Day 13)\n2. __Financial Assessment (Today, Day 14)__\n3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment\n4. Health Assessment\n5. Relationship Assessment\n6. Place & Environment Assessment\n7. Spirituality Assessment\nWhen it comes to Personal Finances, who is on your Board of Advisors? Reach out to them this week, if you can, in order to get some feedback, to effectively complete the assignment with a variety of perspectives. Your relationship to money is closely related to your career, but also has a life of its own. As a case in point, you can have two people, at the same age, in the same job, with the same salary; but who have entirely different saving and spending habits, and therefore one ends up in perpetual debt, while the other is building a comfortable nest egg. Let’s take a deeper look.\nWhen are we supposed to learn how to manage our money? They don’t teach it to us in school. And then we end up graduating college at 22 or going straight to work at 18 years-old, and get thrown into the fire, with expenses to manage and a pay check for the first time. So we learn as we go, on the spot, generally without much guidance. Our parents are only as helpful in this regard as how they demonstrated to us, since we were kids, sensible values and emotions in relation to money – which does not happen in many cases, as they have their own challenges and mental blocks in this regard. Given the powers of Capitalism that essentially run our society – especially in the West – materialism has run rampant. Unfortunately, we have come to value things and money more so than internal content – what one of my role models, Dario Salas, calls Cosmic Currency. However, that does not mean that money “is bad” or that we should not strive to attain it; on the contrary, it is a necessary instrument, that ought to reflect the fruits of our hard work and responsible decision-making in managing our resources. We need to cultivate positive, realistic and balanced views on money, so that we can utilize this form of energy effectively, as a means (not an end) towards achieving our life’s purpose.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"5wWp88CLDiIgg2GS42uYEo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:53.649Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:53.649Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"1iTfnxFCxIiAWCmU4u8UqW","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:33.963Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:33.963Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"b1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/1iTfnxFCxIiAWCmU4u8UqW/68148be00e0a113ef4fdc8f0475220e5/b1.png","details":{"size":2462,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"b1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"What is your relationship with money today (emotionally, psychologically), and how has that changed (if at all) over the past five years?

Financial Assessment (Day 14)\n__3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment (Today – Day 15)__\n3. Health Assessment\n4. Relationship Assessment\n5. Place & Environment Assessment\n6. Spirituality Assessment\nThis is a hard Life Category to name. So many things can fall into this, including some of the other categories; for example, “getting fit” can be a “personal aim”, and “playing golf” can be a “hobby”, although as a sport, it is also an aspect of your Health regimen. While it is sensible for some things to cut across Life Categories, for the purpose of these exercises, I recommend that, if conflicted, you make a conscious choice about what the more relevant category is for that thing. For this Assessment, we are classifying Personal Aims & Hobbies as any topic or area of your life, aside from Career, Health, Travel, Relationships and Spirituality, that is primarily for you – call it “Me Time”, as this is where you spend time and do what makes you happy. Watching TV, reading books and learning a language are some examples. With how busy life can be, it is very easy for some of us – and I will count myself as \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n65\nguilty of this from time to time – to neglect our own needs and interests. Sometimes, we may just need to veg out on the coach, and catch up on our favorite Netflix or HBO series. A life that is go-go-go all the time, is one that I predict is doomed for a crash at some near point. We need to focus some energy on our hobbies to get a break from all the demands being put on us by work, family, society and ourselves! One of the key things to consider here is whether or not you are choosing aims and hobbies that boost your energy versus ones that drain energy.\nSo let’s take a look back and see what you have done for yourself over the past 5 years.

Hopefully, whether you have had this as a daily habit coming in, or you took the direction from Day 8 [Internal Energy Production], you have been meditating and exercising daily for at least the past eight days. If so, I am sure that you feel fantastic right now! If not, no worries – you can restart good health habits anytime.\n1. Career Assessment (Day 13)\n2. Financial Assessment (Day 14)\n3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment (Day 15) \n__4. Health Assessment (Today – Day 16)__\n5. Relationship Assessment\n6. Place & Environment Assessment\n7. Spirituality Assessment\nWithout your health in order, all the rest of your goals lose mean\ning and generally cannot be attained or enjoyed. So that begs the question – how well are you taking care of yourself? Nobody can do it for you. Today, we will be putting you- literally, physically – under the microscope, to examine all aspects of your health. I have brought in one of our health experts – David Owens – to guide this part of the 20/20 journey. David is one of my closest friends; he is also my personal trainer, and in many ways, a big brother. I trust him implicitly. David has been in the fitness industry since 2002, was certified personal trainer through the Equinox Fitness Training Institute (EFTI), and is also certified in Ayurvedic Nutrition, GYROTONIC®, and Moral Physics® from the Salas Sommer Institute. He is currently working on the Moral Courage Project with Irshad Manji. David, take it away!\n__[DAVID OWENS]__\nHi Everyone, and thank you Arman for the gracious introduction and this invitation to participate in the 20/20 Life Vision Challenge – I am honored. Your health is one of those valuable commodities that you may not pay attention to until it is compromised.\nThis is totally understandable, as in today’s world there are so many things that compete for and demand your attention; but when you don’t feel well, that health challenge, depending on its severity, usually takes center stage – and at those moments, we can truly appreciate the importance of good health. There are many facets to health – physical, mental and emotional – and each component requires your energy and attention. Learning how to attend to and balance your health needs is a process; as a child, you didn’t come with instructions; but over time, you can develop wellness skills, so that good hygiene and health become second nature and seamlessly integrate into your life.\nYour health indicators are uniquely personal – we all have subtle differences; and although a large majority of us may share some common health benchmarks, we all are unique individuals with many factors that determine our health, such as – age, profession, gender, genetics etc. The point is not to compare. This is your vision and you have to decide what role health plays in your life. Your position and feelings regarding health are not static, and may vary over time for a number of reasons. Being healthy requires your engagement and persistence and impacts all areas of your life. So lets dive deeper, by putting your health status and recent path under the scope. I will be back with you all next week, when we build off of this self-assessment, and create an exciting and attainable 20/20 Health Vision!\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"3tIoNPkbgkoIckMAC4KqSG","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:45.518Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:45.518Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"6bFW85io002AkY4GCYMCsc","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:26.070Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:26.070Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"b1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/6bFW85io002AkY4GCYMCsc/a95aa71fe3448f1629751c29b37e142a/b1.png","details":{"size":2462,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"b1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"- How much of a priority has your health been for you?\n- How do you feel right now, physical health-wise?

The overview of 7 assessments is below, illustrating what is completed, where we are today, and what is to come in the following days.\n1. Career Assessment (Day 13)\n2. Financial Assessment (Day 14)\n3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment (Day 15)\n4. Health Assessment (Day 16) \n__5. Relationship Assessment (Today – Day 17)__\n6. Place & Environment Assessment\n7. Spirituality Assessment\nThere is no better way to learn about ourselves than through our relationships. They provide the ultimate mirror, and opportunity to connect with a deeper part of ourselves. In the context of goals, just think about when you achieve something great – you generally want to share it with someone or several people who you are close with. It is also a vital Goal Dimension, I feel – Relationship Quality (RQ) – to our overall happiness in life. Lessons from Day 4 (Your Supporting Cast) and Day 6 (The Goals of Others) were good primers for our work today – so you may want to refresh yourself on your worksheets from those days. Speaking of supporting casts, I bring in one of our relationship experts – Ron Baker – to guide today’s portion of the 20/20 journey. Ron is a healer, therapist and guide to thousands of people, including myself, on a 1-1 basis as well as through his books and educational programs. He is insightful, compassionate and downright profound in his life’s work. When you meet Ron, you know that you are facing someone that is living true to his purpose on the planet. Ron, welcome aboard and thank you for leading us through this most delicate topic.\n__[RON BAKER]__\nThanks for the introduction, Arman. This work is a great passion for me, and so it is a privilege to get to make an initial connection with your community.\nThere is so much to say about relationships, it is hard to imagine breaking it down to a few paragraphs. However, as every facet of our lives revolves around the relationships in our lives, anywhere we focus is capable of creating a powerful impact on the quality of our day-to-day. Having done work with thousands of people around the world in the last 25 years around this subject, I am convinced that all of our relationships are a reflection of the relationship we are having with ourselves—including the most intimate partners in our lives.\nThe most basic measuring stick that determines the quality of our relationships boils down to how safe we truly feel to give and receive in mutual value. Typically when I ask my clients whether they feel safer to give OR receive, the vast majority of people say that they feel much safer giving. I suggest this is because it gives us the illusion of being the one “in control” when we give; followed up by a typical experience of feeling vulnerable, exposed and sometimes even unworthy to actually receive.

It most likely opened your heart and created very pleasurable feelings, adding to a sense of having value to add to someone’s life.\n- Next time you face the opportunity of receiving, whether it is a physical gift, a compliment or an investment of time and energy into your life…remember that the other person has the opportunity to experience the same pleasure and trust that they have something of value to offer.\n- Investing in each others’ lives is how we create every single thing. When we simply remember to do it with a conscious choice to truly value — whether we are the one giving or the one receiving — we immediately impact the quality of our day-to-day investment in one another.\nThanks for receiving this lesson of encouragement from me. It means a lot to be able to plant a seed of potential enhancement in your life. In closing, I remind you to “be good to YOU.”\n__[ARMAN ROUSTA]__\nAs I have experienced many before, Ron just dropped some very deep wisdom on us!

The overview of 7 assessments is below, illustrating what is completed, where we are today, and what is to come in the following days.\n1. Career Assessment (Day 13)\n2. Financial Assessment (Day 14)\n3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment (Day 15)\n4. Health Assessment (Day 16)\n5. Relationship Assessment (Day 17) \n__6. Place & Environment Assessment (Today – Day 18)__\n7. Spirituality Assessment\nDo you believe that we actually get to choose our parents, as well as where and when we are born to this life? It is an interesting topic, and one that is very hard to “prove” in a traditional, scientific sense. I do believe in that, as a facet of our karma and destiny – we come into this life with a specific vision and purpose, into scenarios and environments that give us opportunities to manifest that vision as we become conscious of it. Sometimes we move into our truth through intuitive guidance from elders (ie. highly evolved parents) and living in tune with nature, which tends to align us towards our purpose. Regardless of what you believe, there is no denying the power that our environment has on our psyche and productivity. By environment, I’m referring to everything from where you live, who you live with, the water and air quality of your city, what your study, work and rest areas are like, how often you travel to new places, your method of commuting to work and how much time you spend outside, away from technology and closer to nature. In this modern tech-centric era, with travel and relocation more accessible than ever, and now over 50% of the world’s population living in cities rather than rural areas (for the first time ever, we crossed that threshold, just within the past 1o years), the dynamics of Place & Environment for most people are quite different from before. We seem to have both more and less choices at the same time.\nThe goal of today’s lesson is to prompt your awareness regarding the impact of Place & Environment (PE – Goal Type #5 from Day 5’s lesson) on your own health, happiness and productivity. What goals have you had in this area over the past five years, and how much of a priority did you make it to improve or explore new environmental factors (ie. moving to a more spacious apartment, that has more natural sunlight)? Personally, I know that for me, travel is an essential ingredient for me to sustain my creativity and global awareness. Going to new cities and countries is less about seeing tourist sites – although that can also be useful – and more about tapping into different collectives and seeing how human beings in different parts of the world developed their societies, given whatever resources they had and cards they were dealt. This process opens my eyes, and allows me to bring fresh energy and ideas back home. I feel like a new, and different, more evolved person every time I return from travel. Interestingly, in spite of all my extensive global travels, I have always lived, studied and worked in or around New York City, for all 41 years of my life. So I decided to take some input here from my friends who have experienced living and working in at least several different cities.\nThe flip side of this, and another interesting debate, is the idea that “wherever you go, there you are”; we can never escape ourselves, who we are and what makes us tick. Moving from New York to California may give us a change of weather and culture, but it won’t necessarily make us a more fulfilled individual – not to say that it can’t be a contributing factor, but people often put too much weight and hope behind environmental changes, while not often enough taking responsibility for their unhappiness. Just the way we like to blame other people to avoid accountability, we do the same with places.

The overview of 7 assessments is below, illustrating what is completed, where we are today, and what is to come in the following days.\n1. Career Assessment (Day 13)\n2. Financial Assessment (Day 14)\n3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment (Day 15)\n4. Health Assessment (Day 16)\n5. Relationship Assessment (Day 17)\n6. Place & Environment Assessment (Day 18) \n7. __Spirituality Assessment (Today – Day 19)__\n\nGod and Love are the two most confusing and complicated subjects to discuss, assess and contemplate, for nearly everybody. Whether or not we acknowledge it, they touch upon everything that we do, and color all of our plans and goals. Regardless of what you believe today – which may be different from what you were taught as a child, or felt to be true 5 years ago – Spirituality plays a major role in your life; this includes the possibility that you have not thought about nor made a place for it, consciously, in your daily routine. In this way, Spirituality is much like Health – it is influential regardless; and whether and how we prioritize it (or not) will determine how much benefit we derive. All of the prior assessments essentially roll-up into this grand category – as you will notice there have been questions all along related to our emotional health (Day 16) and relationship to self (Day 17).\nYour Spirituality is essentially your life philosophy – what you believe it’s all about, and how that impacts how you think, feel and act. In my view, Spirituality entails the following components, and addresses life’s most profound questions:\n__1. Purpose.__ Why am I here on Planet Earth and in this human form? What is my purpose? \n__2. Self-Knowledge.__ Who am I – at a deeper level, beyond the human form, race, gender and nationality that I came into being as? \n__3. Karma.__ Why do things happen to me and others in the world as they do (i.e. the good, the bad – wars, crimes, etc)? Is it random or pre-destined? \n__4. Destiny.__ Who is in charge here? Do I have to be compliant with a specific religion or Spiritual path in order to be at peace with myself and be in God’s good graces; or is God within us, and we get to self-determine our destinies? Or is everything just random? \n__5. Healing.__ How can I feel tranquil and connected to “something beyond myself” on a day-to-day basis? How do I move through and beyond the pain that I have experienced in life?\nThese are big questions, and not ones that can be answered by the intellect, or within any short period of time. It is a lifetime’s work, for those who are willing to dedicate themselves to an honest self-inquiry process. Having been on such a seeker’s path – consciously since I was 19 (well over 20 years now, over half of my life) – I can attest to my truth at least, that the rewards, such as inner peace, clarity, emotional strength, seemingly magical guidance, and a deeper sense of presence/being/awareness, have been immeasurable. Further, all of the sincerest, emotionally strongest and authentically happiest people that I know are ones that have placed Spirituality as the #1 priority in their lives. My Spiritual mentor, Dario Salas, sums it up best in his latest masterpiece of a book – Cosmic Currency – as follows:\n*\"Usually humans live by virtue of what they have and not by what they are. They are manipulated by a personality that is a part of a system that maintains strict control of their behavior so that it fits within the dominant social scheme.\nConversely, the option to live in the being, through the being and for the being, according to the universe’s highest laws, offers a bonus for the human individual and can lead to the most profound happiness, harmony, order, coherence and wisdom. This depends only on oneself. The human being has inherited a particle of the universe’s divine light and needs the requisite insight to understand that, although in the tiniest amount, this particle is “heaven’s light.” It is what is called the spirit or the being and it is one’s most sacred duty to care for and develop it. If successful, one will have the moral and executive authority of the righteous, allowing one to secure the necessary spiritual and material resources. Then, one will not be just a millionaire bereft of spiritual resources, but a complete and balanced person.\"*\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"7EXMkMaOKQIqkwIEi0C0Yg","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:25.783Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:25.783Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"143c2lG9veCeCkIWQkqeUI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:00.661Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:00.661Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"b1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/143c2lG9veCeCkIWQkqeUI/f922263f52b8b274d9cf70f177164e53/b1.png","details":{"size":2462,"image":{"width":189,"height":162}},"fileName":"b1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"__Spiritual Views__\n- What are your current views and feelings about Spirituality?

Enter Phase 3 – Vision Creation. It’s finally time to start breaking out that bucket list, and bringing all of your forward-looking dreams and BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) to the table. Are you ready?\nFor all of your existence, seeds have been planted in your garden (of life), every single day. Seeds reflect possibilities, they reflect your potential in so many aspects of life. How and what those seeds grow to be is entirely dependent on the attention and nurturing that they get – your Internal Ecology (to use the phrase of my Spiritual teacher, Dario Salas). Some will turn into weeds, due to neglect. While others grow beyond your control and imagination, taking on a life of their own. As you set out upon creating a 20/20 Vision, it is imperative to take full ownership of the seeds being planted in your garden. Your Internal World (Day 10) was, and likely still is, largely influenced by others, who hopefully planted good seeds. Good or bad, as an adult, it is your responsibility to take control over your garden.\nThink Big. Now is the time. We will get into the details later on in the process. Let go of your fears and limitations for the next halfhour, and imagine that anything is possible – because it virtually is. Close your eyes and say the following statement three times (right now, and for the remaining 9 days of the Vision Creation Phase, preferably before doing each day’s assignment).\n\"*In my Life and 20/20 Vision, anything and everything is possible. I will do whatever it takes to discover and fulfill my true Life Purpose – and in doing so, I will become the person that I want to be by the Year of 2020. Nothing can stop me from achieving my 20/20 Goals. I believe in myself, will invest in myself and am open to receiving support from the Universe, in whatever form it may come.*\"\nPowerful stuff. The deeper you are able to silence the skeptical inner voices and allow yourself to believe in this statement, the higher your chances of success will be. Keep practicing this – and other positive mantras, maybe something of your own writing – every day, even if you have to say it 100 times before it “feels” true. You have to believe it as if it already is – that is how successful vision creation works – as if you are seeing into the future and feeling the reality of it.\nJust as we had 7 days of Self-Assessments, we will use the same 7 areas to guide 7 days of Vision Creation (Days 23-29), which will give you a chance to create multi-tiered goals (BHAG, HLA – High Level of Achievement, and MLA – Minimum Level of Achievement). Dream big (Day 22 Lesson) the way Jason Stile did when he saw AjustLock in a dream back in 2008, which led to the creation of Ajustco, now a company valued at over $10 million and growing.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"iilVuzxqSssOc4Q68mMOk","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:19.905Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:19.905Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"4jDnqGRvdmqKM2KgCCESeU","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:50:54.633Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:50:54.633Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"c1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/4jDnqGRvdmqKM2KgCCESeU/a088305be843e6a8a1a451507899c712/c1.png","details":{"size":2662,"image":{"width":199,"height":192}},"fileName":"c1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Imagine different areas of your garden, as in the Life Categories which you have created back on Day 2.

To this point, we have used various visualization, meditation and writing techniques to draw out aspects of your life vision, from deep within your core. That all culminates in today’s core lesson, which also sets the stage for the following 7 days of Vision Creation – How to be a Dreamer. In other words, today’s guidance is for you to tap deeper into your subconscious and illicit your deepest dreams and aspirations for this existence – your life’s purpose.\nWe start with the story of Jason Stile, who I’ve nicknamed “The Dreamer”, from our Panel of Experts. Jason is one of my best friends and my business partner in an up-and-coming product development company called Ajustco. The more you learn about Jason and his life, the more inspired you will be. The key messages that come across are that – A) Your dreams (and subconscious mind) have transformative and illuminating power; B) You can achieve anything that you set your mind to; C) No obstacles or setbacks are too great to overcome, when you have sufficient will power (Remember Day 8’s meditation on Internal Energy Production).\nWho better to tell Jason’s story than the man himself. In this (4 minute) video from 2013, Jason talks about “the dream” that was the seed (reference: Day 21) for the beautiful, fruit-bearing tree that is now a highly successful company, which continues to grow every day. Pay particular attention to these two minutes – from 1:25 – 3:23 – where the inspiration for AjustLock is described. Interestingly enough, when I was approached by Jason to become his business partner, and in the months immediately after signing on, I had three explicit dreams myself which confirmed this direc tion and the future success of Ajustco. More on that another time.\n","refAssignment":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"4tfTJSjn9CM2WE4SY0yGou","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:16.799Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:53:16.799Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"assignment"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"icon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"4Lw7AvcupO86gKC4A0M22m","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:50:50.730Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-03T03:50:50.730Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"c1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/6h184bey8vl3/4Lw7AvcupO86gKC4A0M22m/fadecf9ec74c3ddbdd90758da275f616/c1.png","details":{"size":2662,"image":{"width":199,"height":192}},"fileName":"c1.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"content":"Did you do your mantra today (assigned on Day 21)?

This most important Vision Creation Phase is where you get to dream big and lay the foundation for a fulfilling and productive life.\nBack on Day 13, you were asked to assess the past 5 years of your work life, and essentially answer the question of how fulfilling your current career track has been over that time span. Today, we begin the first of 7 forward-looking Vision Creations, starting in this same area. The same question that I posed on Day 13 comes up again – “To what degree are you doing what you love?” Today, we flash forward to the Year 2020, and the answer is a resounding “YES!!” Now what needs to be done over the next 5 years in order for that statement to become a reality?\nI will tell you a little bit of my story here. I graduated from a great University (Columbia College, in New York City) back in 1996, where all major banks and consulting firms recruit top “talent” every year, giving them big salaries from the get go and putting them on the corporate “fast track” to success. It was the American Dream at work – to compete and be on top of the world, in the world’s finance capital, Wall Street! I did what everyone else was doing – setting up interviews and researching these companies, to make sure I could hold my own when they started drilling me with questions. The process felt like a scene from any of these big corporate power movies – The Devil’s Advocate, The Firm, Wall Street. I wasn’t feeling it. I did get offers though, and considered them. But what really inspired me was the start-up technology world. I wanted to be a major part of a small team that took risks to bring new, innovative products and services to life. I didn’t have any experience in this area, being a new graduate, but I felt inspired when I read and thought about entrepreneurship. I had an inkling of a vision for my career track, and it didn’t have big corporate \nWelcome to Day 23 of the 20/20 Life Vision Challenge!\noffices and a Wall Street lifestyle in it. Not that there is anything wrong with that – in fact, I have many friends that went on that track, and have done very well, financially and personally. It just wasn’t for me, and something inside my being knew it. So I took a chance by joining my friend, Charles Balsamo, at a small startup called Exeter Technologies. We were the Co-Founders – he was CEO and I was CFO, titles we knew little about, but grew into over the next three years. Actually, in a startup, you wear so many hats – I was doing all the Sales & Marketing, as well as some R&D, in addition to HR and Finances. It was the building of my foundation and experience in startup venture building – and I loved every minute of it, even the all-nighters, where we had to work around the clock to meet major deadlines. You see, when you really love what you do, it doesn’t feel like work.
