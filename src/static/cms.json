I am Arman, and I will be your guide. Let’s start with a 5 minute meditation called,‘The Rocking Chair’. Get comfortable, put your phone on silent, turn off the TV, dim the lights and close your eyes. Play some soft music, if it helps you relax.\n\nReady? Now picture yourself in this rocking chair at 90 years old. You are with your grandchildren, reflecting on your life as the sun gracefully sets in the dis-tance. Your grandkids want to know about your life. What will you share with them?\n\nHear the waves softly coming to the shore. Keep your eyes closed and meditate deeply on this question: your life, what has it been? How will you tell this story to the next generation.\nNow come back to present day and compare who you are right now, in relation to that 90-year-old man or woman whose eyes you just saw the world through for the last 5 minutes.","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/Rknt0PorAIG4uoMQAg4KM/d9bea5cb56ac30ed3699b9e07c89a1ac/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-1_.svg"},"type":"MEDITATION","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"My Life Story","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"5VKB8m3jzyCYkQwwkS6qOQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:17:50.603Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:17:50.603Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-1)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/5VKB8m3jzyCYkQwwkS6qOQ/de1dccb9d8a44586d830175413351387/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-1_.svg","details":{"size":161518,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-1).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Review your best life memories, regrets and defining moments from the eyes of your future, 90-year-old self.

What has been hold-ing you back from reaching your full potential? Our vices can completely dis-rupt and ruin otherwise happy and fruitful lives. Now isn’t the time to focus only on the positives and brush character flaws under the rug. It is also quite rare to witness people living at their full potential. However, when you come across those who are at or close to that level, you can feel them beaming with energy, and see how happy – and effective – they are. Do you know someone like that? If so, take note for future role modeling exercises.\n\nIn the movie \"Lucy\", Morgan Freeman delivers a great lecture about what might happen if human beings start using more than 10% of our brains. I definitely rec-ommend watching it. Freeman notes that humans possess 100 billion neurons but only fifteen percent are activated. He goes on to say that \"there are more connections in the human body than there are stars in the galaxy.\" Accordingly, \"we possess a gigantic network of information to which we have almost no access.”\n\nCan you be objective about your own strengths and weaknesses? Objectivity is one of the cornerstones of wisdom and maturity and it is one of the most diffi-cult qualities to possess. It requires us to see ourselves clearly; without bias and judgment – not an easy task. Ask yourself what kind of impression you make on people (not just the first impression, but over time). See yourself through the eyes of others who know you well enough to understand your life path so far.\n\nHave the courage to be honest about yourself but don’t beat yourself up in the process. The concept of “brutal honesty” is just an excuse to be mean to people and put them down to make others feel better.

I am sure that you are already doing things to help the goals of others and to help other people.  Some of us are guilty of doing “too much” for others at the expense of our own needs – which is the other end of the pendulum from selfishness, and equally unsustainable. \n\nThere has to be balance in the way you work for your goals versus those of others.

It sounds more like a business term, but it is more relevant to the quality of our lives. Most people simply don’t have enough fuel to effectively pursue their goals and core responsibilities. Even if they do, they are depleted at the end of each day, and enter couch potato mode after getting home from work. \n\nHow often have you thought of or heard others say, “I don’t have the energy to workout. I’m too tired after work.”? The irony is that, although it takes an amount of energy to exercise, what one gets back from that experience is generally a multiple of what was invested.\n\nWhat are the two most powerful sources of “Internal Energy Production”? \n\n__1. Physical Exercise__-\nThere is all kinds of scientific and personal evidence that confirms how important physical exercise is to our moods and productivity. While most agree, it is typically motivation, prioritization or discipline factors that disrupt our best laid plans of integrating exercise into our lives.\n\n\n__2. Meditation__-\n\nBy meditation, I’m not talking about “meditating on ideas” but the act of using our breathe and body to relax, clear the mind and go deeper into our inner worlds.

What is your life’s purpose? Why have you come here, to Planet Earth, at this point in time, from this family and in this part of the world? With this 20/20 effort, one step at a time, you are creating and refining that vision.\n\nDuring Step 4, I introduced the concept of being the CEOofMe and building a Board of Advisors, a supporting, positive cast of friends, family, colleagues and mentors. Let’s now consider the influence of a different group – Role Models, Idols or Archetypes. The difference between role models and mentors is that role models can be people that you either don’t know personally, or that you do not have regular contact with. For example, kids idolize movie stars, athletes and celebrities, for various reasons, not all of which are long lasting or necessarily beneficial. Our (Western) society certainly puts a lot of unrealistic and fantastical ideas in our minds, through advertising and other unconscious forms of hero worship. Hopefully, as we grow older, we create more separation between fantasy and reality. Archetypes are role models who are not necessarily who we think they are – after all, how do we really know who someone is from a magazine or TV program?\n\nFrom where you stand today, who do you consider to be your role models? Hopefully, you have some direct contact with at least one or several people who you really look up to, and seek in some ways to emulate. I recommend identifying or finding at least one role model from your contacts, and then at least one who presents an ideal, that you do not personally know (e.g., maybe someone in your trade that has achieved success). Whose life looks good to you, not just in terms of what they may have materially, but in terms of their inner content, quality of their relationships and their aura – the energy that they give off? Our role models often change as we evolve, moving through different phases of our lives, and therefore, it is OK to “retire” role models, in favor of new ones.\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/5CLDBAzoDSsKsKQqo6kEQo/bfb7bbef8a48b15dc57ec8f433bcee99/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-9_.svg"},"type":"MEDITATION","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Role Models","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"1rC4VYHVuYqu8IE8uGegCm","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T12:23:03.331Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T12:23:03.331Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-9)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/1rC4VYHVuYqu8IE8uGegCm/e9cb46f21c9da8f923495bf1ed69d292/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-9_.svg","details":{"size":202408,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-9).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Think about your role models, those who you aspire to be like and can learn from.","assignments":[{"content":"Who are your current role models?\n\n","icon":null},{"icon":null,"content":"What Life Category does he/she primarily influence?"},{"icon":null,"content":"To what degree do you know and interact with each Advisor personally?

They provide the ultimate mirror, and opportunity to connect with a deeper part of ourselves. In the context of goals, just think about when you achieve something great – you generally want to share it with someone or several people who you are close with. It is also a vital Goal Dimension, I feel – Relationship Quality (RQ) – to our overall happiness in life. \n\nI’d like to introduce you to one of our relationship experts – Ron Baker – to guide this portion of your 20/20 journey. Ron is an insightful, compassionate and downright profound healer, therapist and guide to thousands of people, including myself, on a 1-1 basis as well as through his books and educational programs. It’s clear that Ron lives true to his purpose on the planet. Ron, welcome aboard and thank you for leading us through this most delicate topic.\n\n__RON BAKER__\n\n\"There is so much to say about relationships. It is hard to imagine breaking this topic down in a few paragraphs. Having done 25 years of work with thousands of people around the world, I am convinced that all of your relationships, including the most intimate partners in your lives, are reflections of the relationship you have with yourself.\n\nThe most basic determinant of the quality of your relationships is how safe you truly feel to give and receive in mutual value. Typically, when I ask my clients whether they feel safer to give OR receive, the vast majority of people say that they feel much safer giving. I suggest this is because it gives us the illusion of being the one “in control” when we give, followed by a typical experience of feeling vulnerable, exposed and sometimes even unworthy to actually receive. Rather than getting caught up in the psychological reasons WHY we might hold these fears, let’s challenge these limitations in some very simple and nurturing ways that have proved to be safe and effective in so many others’ lives clear ways to make improvements in the quality of your day-to-day.\n\nIn closing, I remind you to “be good to YOU.”\n\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/1dsAl6R1tIseCiaeSOsa6Y/74770e875fd2661b221558d0ba4dc2a6/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-17_.svg"},"type":"SELF-ASSESSMENT","duration":10,"stepScreenDescription":"Relationships","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"2UeY7r1x04ACeuaQewEUgo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T12:33:57.473Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T12:33:57.473Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-17)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/2UeY7r1x04ACeuaQewEUgo/17969a96dbdd727bd4bcdaa1afe71016/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-17_.svg","details":{"size":255150,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-17).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Assess the quality of your relationships.

Have you thought about your Spirituality consciously? Is it part of your daily routine? I bet you'd be surprised how much it touches your life. Emotional health (step 16) and relationship to health (Step 17) are inexticably linked to your spiritual self or rather life philosophy.\n\nIn my view, Spirituality entails the following components, and addresses life’s most profound questions:\n__1. Purpose__-- Why am I here on Planet Earth? What is my purpose? \n__2. Self-Knowledge__-- Who am I on a deeper level, beyond the human form, race, gender and nationality that I came into being as? \n__3. Karma__-- Why do things happen to me and others in the world as they do (e.g., the good, the bad – wars, crimes, etc)? Is it random or pre-destined? \n__4. Destiny__-- Who is in charge here? Do I have to be compliant with a specific religion or Spiritual path in order to be at peace with myself and be in God’s good graces? Or is God within us, and we get to self-determine our destinies? Or is everything just random? \n__5. Healing__-- How can I feel tranquil and connected to “something beyond myself” on a day-to-day basis? How do I move through and beyond the pain that I have experienced in life?\n\nIt will take a lifetime to answer these questions. But start thinking about them now, if you haven't already.

In this Step, we flash forward 5 years from now, and the answer is a resounding “YES!!” Think about what needs to be done over the next 5 years in order for that statement to become a reality.\n\nI’ll share some of my own career dreams. In 1996, I graduated from a Columbia College in New York City, where all major banks and consulting firms recruit top “talent” every year, giving them big salaries and putting them on the corporate “fast track” to success. It was the American Dream at work \n– to compete and be on top of the world, in the world’s finance capital, Wall Street! I did what everyone else did – set up interviews and researched these companies, prepared answers to tough questions like a scene from The Devil’s Advocate, The Firm, or Wall Street. I got offers, and considered them.\n\nBut, I wasn’t feeling it. The start-up technology world really inspired me. The thought of having to take risks to bring new, innovative products and services to life was exciting. I had an inkling of a vision for my career track, and it didn’t include a big corporation.\n\nSo I took a chance by joining my friend, Charles Balsamo, as a co-founder at a small startup called Exeter Technologies. He was CEO and I was CFO, titles we knew little about, but grew into over the next three year. I did all the Sales and Marketing, Research and Development, Human Resources and Finances. It was the building of my foundation and experience in the startup venture world and I loved every minute of it, even the all-nighters, where we had to work around the clock to meet major deadlines. When you really love what you do, it doesn’t feel like work. And that is what I have always sought after. 20 years later, I con-tinue this journey, doing what I love every single day.\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/1KrAqo0UdW06ouqQgc4YsG/619745dc7384c29c6d2105bec33e5367/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-23_.svg"},"type":"VISION CREATION","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Career Dreams","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"38gRTdMYuIwMoUoY8IwiOs","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T09:44:20.504Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T09:44:20.504Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-23)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/38gRTdMYuIwMoUoY8IwiOs/ae2a686831ab998ce9972a902f775336/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-23_.svg","details":{"size":297358,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-23).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"cChallenge yourself to think about your career Big Hairy Audacious Goals.

We’ve all heard the phrase “More Money, More Problems”, a popular lament of the rich and famous, who oftentimes have difficulty with managing money. While we may idolize these celebrities for their stature and seeming access to the finer things in life, how come it seems that many of them are not all that happy? I believe it has to do with two main factors:\n\n__1__- Money may be nice to have, and can surely temporarily help you live a more comfortable and stress-free lifestyle (if managed well), but it does not bring long-lasting joy.\n\n__2__- The energy surrounding money and material things is overwhelming, and attracts many negative forces. Think about the entourages and all-of-a-sudden “friends” that wealthy athletes have after signing big contracts. Everyone lining up for the money train, including financial “advisors”, lawyers and others that “want to help”, causing confusion and These folks did not build a proper Board of Advisors. \n\nYou don’t have to be multi-millionaire celebrities to experience these negative effects.

It’s David Owens from Step 16. This current Step is usually where you begin to bump up against some of the internal (e.g., inner negative voices) and external (e.g., finding time) obstacles that can prevent you from reaching your goals.  The good news is that, with persistence and creativity all the goals you seek to achieve can be accomplished. You have to be honest and fair though as well. \n \nFor example, if you’ve never run long distance in your life, you are potentially setting yourself up for failure if you aspire to run a marathon in one month, and do so in under 3 hours. Set goals that will inspire you to stretch yet that are also within your grasp, and not so challenging that you become discouraged. Also, don’t be afraid to try new things (other than a gym workout) that better fit your persona.  Try tai chi, yoga, Gyrotonic or swimming. \n\nRemember the basics: \n\n__Nutrition and Diet__\n\nThough it is cliché – you are what you eat. Being active is very important; but what you eat, the quality of the food, and the quantity are factors if not taken into consideration, can undo all of the hard work you put in. If you don’t like to cook, consider looking into food companies that make healthy prepackaged meals. If you like to cook or want to learn a new skill, the culinary arts are wide open for exploration.\n\n__Sleep__\n\nSleep hygiene is such a highly under-appreciated component to your health and well-being. Everyone has different requirements for the amount of sleep they need to operate at an optimal level, but the quality of the sleep is just as important. If you consistently need coffee or other stimulants to make it through the day, you’re not getting enough quality sleep. Try out a sleep ritual to help to slumber off. \n\n__Body Care__\n\nJust like a car, your body needs maintenance and check-ups (not necessarily of the medical doctor kind). Massage, acupuncture and chiropractic adjustments are some of the more pop- ular alternative means of self-care.\n\n__Mental and Emotional Health__\n\nAs a complex being, your mental and emotional health are key components to your physical health. Make sure you have someone to talk to, whether it’s a friend or a professional. We need to be heard and understood. \n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/16LMXn0DTGeCqqKewYwYS8/f8ccd4822f37a263331078afe32c441a/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-26_.svg"},"type":"VISION CREATION","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Health Dreams","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"1gbed7lrsmj4"}},"id":"4twOxB14U0kwqei6mok4wo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-09-29T11:36:50.322Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-29T11:36:50.322Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-26)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1gbed7lrsmj4/4twOxB14U0kwqei6mok4wo/ffa8b2963ca0703f9eb2438130d74a89/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-26_.svg","details":{"size":321618,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-26).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Put away those inner negative voices and accept new ones that launch you into a new, healthier you.","assignments":[{"icon":null,"content":"What changes and achievements will you make across the following areas?\n- Prioritizing your Health Goals vs. other Areas\n- Fitness & Exercise\n- Nutrition & Diet\n- Sleep\n- Body Care\n- Mental & Emotional Health "},{"icon":null,"content":"Who you want to make drastic improvements in their physical health?\nHow exactly do you want them to change?\nHow can you help them achieve this goal?

Deepening your value of self is integral to valuing and interacting with others in the balance of giving and receiving. \n\nWe live on a planet that has primitive emotional tools and education.

I believe that an enhanced reality is built by making a clear investment in the specific goals and experiences that you decide are important in our lives.

The deeper you go, the more your goals will fall into alignment with the Master plan.\n\nRemember your Board of Advisors, first introduced on Step 4? Good mentors tend to bring everything back to your life purpose and inner journey. There is so much controversy and differences of opinion regarding spiritual philosophy. There are also  a lot of pretenders and predators who don’t have either real knowledge or good intentions, but who prey off of others who are authentically eager and open to guidance. Follow your heart and intuition when it comes to aligning with any type of spiritual teacher or guide.\n\nToday, in building on the mentorship concept, I want to encourage you to consider what other types of support structures you have in your life. It’s not all about having a be-all, end-all mentor, which is not easy to find. \n\nSometimes, having peers, who are at or around your same level, can be as helpful as having a mentor; because those people are going through the same challenges as you are can relate.  Ideally, you would have both – guidance from those who have walked in your shoes and moved further along the path, as well as those who are walking the walk, right by your side. Be it a formal support group, or informal group of friends, you really need this type of support . \nWithout these support networks, its easier to fall back on bad habits, loneliness, depression and other “negative” emotions.
