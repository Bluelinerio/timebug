Your grandkids want to know about your life. What will you share with them?\n\nHear the waves softly coming to the shore.

What has been hold-ing you back from reaching your full potential? Our vices can completely dis-rupt and ruin otherwise happy and fruitful lives. Now isn’t the time to focus only on the positives and brush character flaws under the rug. It is also quite rare to witness people living at their full potential. However, when you come across those who are at or close to that level, you can feel them beaming with energy, and see how happy – and effective – they are. Do you know someone like that? If so, take note for future role modeling exercises.\n\nIn the movie \"Lucy\", Morgan Freeman delivers a great lecture about what might happen if human beings start using more than 10% of our brains. I definitely rec-ommend watching it. Freeman notes that humans possess 100 billion neurons but only fifteen percent are activated. He goes on to say that \"there are more connections in the human body than there are stars in the galaxy.\" Accordingly, \"we possess a gigantic network of information to which we have almost no access.”\n\nCan you be objective about your own strengths and weaknesses? Objectivity is one of the cornerstones of wisdom and maturity and it is one of the most diffi-cult qualities to possess. It requires us to see ourselves clearly; without bias and judgment – not an easy task. Ask yourself what kind of impression you make on people (not just the first impression, but over time). See yourself through the eyes of others who know you well enough to understand your life path so far.\n\nHave the courage to be honest about yourself but don’t beat yourself up in the process.

The 7 Goal Types","subtitle":"Welcome to Day 5 of the 20/20 Life Vision Challenge! Life Goals","description":"What kind of attitude and approach do you have towards goal-setting and life goals? Do you not think about it much, just trying to make it through the days, or taking things as they come? Or are you a go getter and a task master? In looking back at my own goals over the years, I recognized the need for more classification, as there were vastly different types of goals; some goals are very specific and tangible, while others are based more on feelings and dynamics between people. This breakdown of the 7 Goal Types gave me more clarity on what exactly I wanted to achieve. I hope that it will do the same for you on your journey.\nSo here are the 7 Types of Goals. As you read through them, think about which ones are most relevant to you.\n__1. ET Type__ – Energy & Time allocation. ET implies the process of setting and tracking goals through the filters of how we allocate our time and energy. \n__2. AS Type__ – Achievements & Skills. “I want to speak Spanish fluently” or “I want to run a marathon”. Things from your bucket list, and experiences that you would like to have, generally go in here.\n__3. HI Type__ – Health Indicators. “I want to live and be healthy until 100.” or “I want to quit smoking”. Anything to do with our own bodily health.\n__4. IQ Type__ – Internal Qualities. “I want to be more confident.” (While this is subjective, we can use a scale to measure this self-assessment) \n__5. PE Type__ – Place & Environment. “I want to take more vacations this year.” or “I want to move to California within 5 years.”\n__6. MO Type__ – Material Outcomes. “I want to have $1 million dollars.” Or “I want to get six pack abs this year.” \n__7. RQ Type__ – Relationship Quality. “I want to have a better relationship with my father.” or “I want to be regarded as a wellliked colleague at my company.”\nThe distinctions of these 7 Goal Types are important because the approaches to attaining each Goal Type vary, and some, for example Material Outcomes, are often not under our direct control. The Types are ordered actually, from what is most under our control to what is least under our control. I encourage people to have all seven goal types, but to separate them out in order to have some clarity. There will be overlap, where certain goals fit into different types; in that case, I recommend assigning one as the primary type, and any others as secondary.\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/3yIAo9TD4IE06mwUcYg8ku/d9db7d6def32dd6fdb21f6f52f674b6f/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-5_.svg"},"type":"MEDITATION","color":"#005587","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"The 7 Goal Types","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"5C61qDha3S0uw8oS0Ke8ik","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-09-13T17:14:20.743Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:21:59.768Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Step-5)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/5C61qDha3S0uw8oS0Ke8ik/ac38c8f1baf8e53870b49f89e5fd2792/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-5_.svg","details":{"size":9856,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Step-5).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"What kind of attitude and approach do you have towards goal-setting and life goals?

Now it’s your turn to give, and possibly sit on some Boards for other CEO of Mes. What are their goals and dreams, and how can you play a small or large part in supporting them?\n\nWhile I am a big believer in individuality and self-determination, the big picture puts into perspective the reality that we are all connected and impact each other in very direct and also in- credibly subtle ways. \n\nThis lesson is a call to action for you to open your mind and heart to this truth, and then commit it as a priority in your 20/20 Life Vision. I am sure that you are already doing things to help the goals of others and to help other people.  Some of us are guilty of doing “too much” for others at the expense of our own needs – which is the other end of the pendulum from selfishness, and equally unsustainable. \n\nThere has to be balance in the way you work for your goals versus those of others. Wherever you can find ways to share common goals with others, be it at work or with your family, incredible opportunities for power, human connection and collective achievement exist (e.g., think about a sports team winning a championship, and what the experience they shared, and the life long bonds created as a result).\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/44on2DfaXm0m8AAs6MqE8I/0b37f79ed82af8f55e2ca625b855deb2/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-6_.svg"},"type":"MEDITATION","color":"#005587","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"The Goals of Others","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"71D94tAC0EG6sIWg8uOokk","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-09-13T17:15:55.617Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:23:57.196Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-6)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/71D94tAC0EG6sIWg8uOokk/a28a2866a1ef918b41c296e482a78c97/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-6_.svg","details":{"size":186583,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-6).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Climb outside of your own box and consider the goals of others around you.","audio":{"uri":"https://assets.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/1zBVW4qDaQqe06aKy0eum4/062bbfa47a9254fbeb31885d98d70705/20-20-16-Phase-1-Step-6.mp3"},"checkin":{"text":"It takes a village.

Today’s meditation is a reflection on what usually happens to us after we set goals. Sit down, and clear your mind, so that you can read this with focus, and answer the assignment questions with clarity.\nBy the way, it is highly recommended that you exercise every day while you are doing this challenge.\nGoal Setting feels great, doesn’t it? When we set goals, we’re right in that moment of vision and inspiration. This is the fun part, where we can think freely and have no limits. What typically happens after we set goals however, does not always transpire the way we planned it, does it?\nThere are several Common Goal Outcomes (CGOs), which I have playfully named and outlined below:\n__1. Bench Warmer.__ The goal sits on the shelf (or the bench)…and collects dust. We avoid it or procrastinate it in any way possible.\n__2. Fast Starter.__ We get out of the gate quickly and enthusiastically, only to see our drive (towards the goal) decline over time, until finally it fizzles out. Or we use the old “Life got in the way” rationale to justify giving up on it. \n__3. Breeze Through.__ “Crushed it!” Not only do you achieve the goal, but you blow it out of the water. This wasn’t even close. And it didn’t even require significant effort. Just a moment – was this a setup for an easy victory? If so, anything wrong with that?\n__4. (Self?) Sabotage.__ Everything is going great, and you’re right on track to get it done. You wanted to win the race, and you’re winning by a mile. Then, at the last minute, all of a sudden, something happens, and you abort the mission. A “more important” priority came up – an exciting new opportunity, or maybe just a new distraction. Somehow, you lost total motivation in an instant, whether or not the sabotage was self-imposed or brought about by an external situation. “Life just got in the way” works well here (as a common excuse) also. \n__5. NFLOE = Not For Lack Of Effort.__ You hustled and put in significant energy, and fought all the way to the finish. The effort was there, but the results did not come through as specified by the goal (i.e. “Win a championship” or “Lose 25 pounds.”) It just wasn’t enough. Maybe you underestimated what it would take to achieve this goal; but at least now, if you take a technical approach, you have the experience and learnings to inform your goal-setting for next time around. \n__6. Right On Point.__ You charted out a plan, and followed through. You nailed it! \n__7. Latency Effect.__ For Outcomes 5 & 6 above, there is something interesting that can happen after the goal deadline expires. After you put the result in the books – as a “success” or “failure”, something happens, and the outcome changes. All of a sudden, that promotion that you worked so hard for, comes through! Or conversely, your nice achievement, after initial success, falls apart. This can be very positive, and if one pays attention, good for future goal-setting skill, as you get a better feeling for how long it may take to achieve certain goals (which is usually longer than we think!)\nAs you go about a new round of annual and 5-year contemplation, on your life and how it progressed (or not) along the desired path from 2011-2015, consider bucketing your goals into these 7 Outcome categories. See any patterns? Keep this in mind when mapping your #2020life.\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/6hCpN8tXsQUaKm60oUaMgc/21aabc1a234f503de9d462650f4a807b/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-7_.svg"},"type":"MEDITATION","color":"#005587","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"What Happens After We Set Goals?","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"6hCpN8tXsQUaKm60oUaMgc","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-09-13T17:14:57.525Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:22:49.391Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-7)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/6hCpN8tXsQUaKm60oUaMgc/21aabc1a234f503de9d462650f4a807b/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-7_.svg","details":{"size":190872,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-7).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Today’s meditation is a reflection on what usually happens to us after we set goals.","audio":{"uri":"https://assets.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/3d9v0EgigME4UwQik0ywkW/df9f8602b71afd978ae9074edeac1efe/20-20-17-Phase-1-Step-7.mp3"},"assignments":[{"icon":null,"content":"What are 5 of your goals from the past 5 years?"},{"icon":null,"content":"Classify them according to the 7 Common Goal Outcomes listed below."},{"icon":null,"content":"Have you noticed any patterns?

It sounds more like a business term, but it is more relevant to the quality of our lives. Most people simply don’t have enough fuel to effectively pursue their goals and core responsibilities. Even if they do, they are depleted at the end of each day, and enter couch potato mode after getting home from work. \n\nHow often have you thought of or heard others say, “I don’t have the energy to workout. I’m too tired after work.”? The irony is that, although it takes an amount of energy to exercise, what one gets back from that experience is generally a multiple of what was invested.\n\nWhat are the two most powerful sources of “Internal Energy Production”? \n\n__1. Physical Exercise__-\nThere is all kinds of scientific and personal evidence that confirms how important physical exercise is to our moods and productivity.

What is your life’s purpose? Why have you come here, to Planet Earth, at this point in time, from this family and in this part of the world? With this 20/20 effort, one step at a time, you are creating and refining that vision.\n\nDuring Step 4, I introduced the concept of being the CEOofMe and building a Board of Advisors, a supporting, positive cast of friends, family, colleagues and mentors. Let’s now consider the influence of a different group – Role Models, Idols or Archetypes. The difference between role models and mentors is that role models can be people that you either don’t know personally, or that you do not have regular contact with. For example, kids idolize movie stars, athletes and celebrities, for various reasons, not all of which are long lasting or necessarily beneficial. Our (Western) society certainly puts a lot of unrealistic and fantastical ideas in our minds, through advertising and other unconscious forms of hero worship. Hopefully, as we grow older, we create more separation between fantasy and reality. Archetypes are role models who are not necessarily who we think they are – after all, how do we really know who someone is from a magazine or TV program?\n\nFrom where you stand today, who do you consider to be your role models? Hopefully, you have some direct contact with at least one or several people who you really look up to, and seek in some ways to emulate. I recommend identifying or finding at least one role model from your contacts, and then at least one who presents an ideal, that you do not personally know (e.g., maybe someone in your trade that has achieved success). Whose life looks good to you, not just in terms of what they may have materially, but in terms of their inner content, quality of their relationships and their aura – the energy that they give off? Our role models often change as we evolve, moving through different phases of our lives, and therefore, it is OK to “retire” role models, in favor of new ones.\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/5CLDBAzoDSsKsKQqo6kEQo/0a4aeaf341b2ca6ee8b41a3c9aab51a0/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-9_.svg"},"type":"MEDITATION","color":"#005587","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Role Models","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"1rC4VYHVuYqu8IE8uGegCm","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-09-13T17:14:54.323Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:22:45.999Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-9)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/1rC4VYHVuYqu8IE8uGegCm/ebd6619c2f3b107b5c3168fde12b36aa/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-9_.svg","details":{"size":202408,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-9).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Think about your role models, those who you aspire to be like and can learn from.","audio":{"uri":"https://assets.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/14YnXRWrc4Ko62Is0EkAgE/4e4799e538e0b19cf3ff945991c768c7/20-20-21-Phase-1-Step-9.mp3"},"checkin":{"text":"Role Models.","title":"Role Models","action":{"type":"link","payload":{"link":"journey/rewards?reward=9"}},"message":"We choose our role models because they inspire us.

Is there part of you that had a reaction to that prescription, setting off internal voices like “I don’t have time for that“, “I’m too busy“, “He doesn’t understand my life’s challenges“, “What does he know anyway?”, etc. Don’t worry, I’ve heard it all before – inside my own head! How do we become more aware of these voices, some of which are so subtle yet influential, that we don’t even hear them – we just act upon their suggestions. Here is where we start to explore the deeper psychology behind our personalities, both conscious and unconscious.\nEach of us has a diverse internal world, rich with varying emotions, thoughts and behavior patterns. While we do change, hopefully for the better, over time, many of our patterns are sticky and continue manifesting over time, possibly taking slightly different new forms. In order to develop and then go out and attain any type of meaningful life vision, it is imperative to “Know Thyself” as intimately as possible – or should I say, “Know Thyselves”? Just like any community or family has multiple personalities and voices, that oftentimes want different things, each of us has different aspects of ego-personality within – let’s call those different “I’s”, as in “Greedy I”, “Generous I”, “Lazy I”, “Motivated I”, “Obsessive I”, “Calm I”, etc. How well coordinated and integrated those different I’s are, to a large extent, determines how much energy we have, how successful we are in our endeavors, and how good we feel overall. You literally have to develop internal leadership skills and claim your rightful place as the CEO of Me, with the understanding that your internal company called “Me” actually consists of hundreds of different “I’s” that all want to be the boss or just do their own thing without accountability to the collective “Me”. This is where self-sabotage comes from. Just on the day when you have that big presentation at work or school, that you worked so hard to prepare for, one of your I’s decides to throw a tantrum, gets really nervous or oversleeps, throwing off your flow. I’m sure that each of us can come up with plenty of examples, both positive and negative, of how our internal order or chaos directly influenced our outcomes.\nThinking about your internal world like it is that company or even a country called “Me” (or whatever you want to name it – your own name, or for the sake of this exercise, come up with a name). On Day 3, you created a list of Strengths & Weaknesses; reflect on that list, which will relate directly to what we are embarking on today, a deeper dive into knowing thyself, which will help you understand what internal processes and negotiations are manifesting in those qualities that show up externally as strengths and weaknesses. Making this connection is vital towards the overall aim here of discovering and harmonizing with your life’s purpose.","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/Y5r1nDqh0Y02GKCeUekMC/93ad67b978dac22dc96a9b6011ca0626/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-10_.svg"},"type":"MEDITATION","color":"#005587","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Mapping Out Your Internal World","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"Y5r1nDqh0Y02GKCeUekMC","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-09-13T17:14:53.264Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:22:43.801Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-10)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/Y5r1nDqh0Y02GKCeUekMC/93ad67b978dac22dc96a9b6011ca0626/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-10_.svg","details":{"size":213939,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-10).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Each of us has a diverse internal world, rich with varying emotions, thoughts and behavior patterns.

The overview of 7 assessments is below, illustrating what is completed, where we are today, and what is to come in the following days.\n1. Career Assessment (Day 13)\n2. Financial Assessment (Day 14)\n3. Personality & Hobbies Assessment (Day 15)\n4. Health Assessment (Day 16) \n__5. Relationship Assessment (Today – Day 17)__\n6. Place & Environment Assessment\n7. Spirituality Assessment\nThere is no better way to learn about ourselves than through our relationships. They provide the ultimate mirror, and opportunity to connect with a deeper part of ourselves. In the context of goals, just think about when you achieve something great – you generally want to share it with someone or several people who you are close with. It is also a vital Goal Dimension, I feel – Relationship Quality (RQ) – to our overall happiness in life. Lessons from Day 4 (Your Supporting Cast) and Day 6 (The Goals of Others) were good primers for our work today – so you may want to refresh yourself on your worksheets from those days. Speaking of supporting casts, I bring in one of our relationship experts – Ron Baker – to guide today’s portion of the 20/20 journey. Ron is a healer, therapist and guide to thousands of people, including myself, on a 1-1 basis as well as through his books and educational programs. He is insightful, compassionate and downright profound in his life’s work. When you meet Ron, you know that you are facing someone that is living true to his purpose on the planet. Ron, welcome aboard and thank you for leading us through this most delicate topic.\n__[RON BAKER]__\nThanks for the introduction, Arman. This work is a great passion for me, and so it is a privilege to get to make an initial connection with your community.\nThere is so much to say about relationships, it is hard to imagine breaking it down to a few paragraphs. However, as every facet of our lives revolves around the relationships in our lives, anywhere we focus is capable of creating a powerful impact on the quality of our day-to-day. Having done work with thousands of people around the world in the last 25 years around this subject, I am convinced that all of our relationships are a reflection of the relationship we are having with ourselves—including the most intimate partners in our lives.\nThe most basic measuring stick that determines the quality of our relationships boils down to how safe we truly feel to give and receive in mutual value. Typically when I ask my clients whether they feel safer to give OR receive, the vast majority of people say that they feel much safer giving. I suggest this is because it gives us the illusion of being the one “in control” when we give; followed up by a typical experience of feeling vulnerable, exposed and sometimes even unworthy to actually receive. Rather than getting caught up in the psychological reasons WHY we might hold these fears, let’s challenge these limitations in some very simple and nurturing ways that have proved to be safe and effective in so many others’ lives—clear ways to make improvements in the quality of your day-to-day.\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/4eju92kZuEWa4SSSWSwOAe/eb73b46725ba00c8ac18c23ba8fd950b/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-17_.svg"},"type":"SELF-ASSESSMENT","color":"#F78C00","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Relationships… How Do I Connect With Others?","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"2QkLhiW1y8OuyWiAekYeGK","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:51:18.879Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:25:51.007Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons- Day-17 ","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/2QkLhiW1y8OuyWiAekYeGK/f1d062b95ae403960fd4f828a026f1da/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-17_.png","details":{"size":17593,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-_Day-17_.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"snippet":"Today, you have on tap the 5th of 7 assessments – Relationships.

Have you thought about your Spirituality consciously? Is it part of your daily routine? I bet you'd be surprised how much it touches your life. Emotional health (step 16) and relationship to health (Step 17) are inexticably linked to your spiritual self or rather life philosophy.\n\nIn my view, Spirituality entails the following components, and addresses life’s most profound questions:\n__1. Purpose__-- Why am I here on Planet Earth? What is my purpose? \n__2. Self-Knowledge__-- Who am I on a deeper level, beyond the human form, race, gender and nationality that I came into being as? \n__3. Karma__-- Why do things happen to me and others in the world as they do (e.g., the good, the bad – wars, crimes, etc)? Is it random or pre-destined? \n__4. Destiny__-- Who is in charge here? Do I have to be compliant with a specific religion or Spiritual path in order to be at peace with myself and be in God’s good graces? Or is God within us, and we get to self-determine our destinies? Or is everything just random? \n__5. Healing__-- How can I feel tranquil and connected to “something beyond myself” on a day-to-day basis? How do I move through and beyond the pain that I have experienced in life?\n\nIt will take a lifetime to answer these questions. But start thinking about them now, if you haven't already.

Enter Phase 3 – Vision Creation. It’s finally time to start breaking out that bucket list, and bringing all of your forward-looking dreams and BHAGs (Big Hairy Audacious Goals) to the table. Are you ready?\nFor all of your existence, seeds have been planted in your garden (of life), every single day. Seeds reflect possibilities, they reflect your potential in so many aspects of life. How and what those seeds grow to be is entirely dependent on the attention and nurturing that they get – your Internal Ecology (to use the phrase of my Spiritual teacher, Dario Salas). Some will turn into weeds, due to neglect. While others grow beyond your control and imagination, taking on a life of their own. As you set out upon creating a 20/20 Vision, it is imperative to take full ownership of the seeds being planted in your garden. Your Internal World (Day 10) was, and likely still is, largely influenced by others, who hopefully planted good seeds. Good or bad, as an adult, it is your responsibility to take control over your garden.\nThink Big. Now is the time. We will get into the details later on in the process. Let go of your fears and limitations for the next halfhour, and imagine that anything is possible – because it virtually is. Close your eyes and say the following statement three times (right now, and for the remaining 9 days of the Vision Creation Phase, preferably before doing each day’s assignment).\n\"*In my Life and 20/20 Vision, anything and everything is possible. I will do whatever it takes to discover and fulfill my true Life Purpose – and in doing so, I will become the person that I want to be by the Year of 2020. Nothing can stop me from achieving my 20/20 Goals. I believe in myself, will invest in myself and am open to receiving support from the Universe, in whatever form it may come.*\"\nPowerful stuff. The deeper you are able to silence the skeptical inner voices and allow yourself to believe in this statement, the higher your chances of success will be. Keep practicing this – and other positive mantras, maybe something of your own writing – every day, even if you have to say it 100 times before it “feels” true. You have to believe it as if it already is – that is how successful vision creation works – as if you are seeing into the future and feeling the reality of it.\nJust as we had 7 days of Self-Assessments, we will use the same 7 areas to guide 7 days of Vision Creation (Days 23-29), which will give you a chance to create multi-tiered goals (BHAG, HLA – High Level of Achievement, and MLA – Minimum Level of Achievement).

To this point, we have used various visualization, meditation and writing techniques to draw out aspects of your life vision, from deep within your core. That all culminates in today’s core lesson, which also sets the stage for the following 7 days of Vision Creation – How to be a Dreamer. In other words, today’s guidance is for you to tap deeper into your subconscious and illicit your deepest dreams and aspirations for this existence – your life’s purpose.\nWe start with the story of Jason Stile, who I’ve nicknamed “The Dreamer”, from our Panel of Experts. Jason is one of my best friends and my business partner in an up-and-coming product development company called Ajustco. The more you learn about Jason and his life, the more inspired you will be. The key messages that come across are that – A) Your dreams (and subconscious mind) have transformative and illuminating power; B) You can achieve anything that you set your mind to; C) No obstacles or setbacks are too great to overcome, when you have sufficient will power (Remember Day 8’s meditation on Internal Energy Production).\nWho better to tell Jason’s story than the man himself. In this (4 minute) video from 2013, Jason talks about “the dream” that was the seed (reference: Day 21) for the beautiful, fruit-bearing tree that is now a highly successful company, which continues to grow every day. Pay particular attention to these two minutes – from 1:25 – 3:23 – where the inspiration for AjustLock is described. Interestingly enough, when I was approached by Jason to become his business partner, and in the months immediately after signing on, I had three explicit dreams myself which confirmed this direction and the future success of Ajustco.

This most important Vision Creation Phase is where you get to dream big and lay the foundation for a fulfilling and productive life.\nBack on Day 13, you were asked to assess the past 5 years of your work life, and essentially answer the question of how fulfilling your current career track has been over that time span. Today, we begin the first of 7 forward-looking Vision Creations, starting in this same area. The same question that I posed on Day 13 comes up again – “To what degree are you doing what you love?” Today, we flash forward to the Year 2020, and the answer is a resounding “YES!!” Now what needs to be done over the next 5 years in order for that statement to become a reality?\nI will tell you a little bit of my story here. I graduated from a great University (Columbia College, in New York City) back in 1996, where all major banks and consulting firms recruit top “talent” every year, giving them big salaries from the get go and putting them on the corporate “fast track” to success. It was the American Dream at work – to compete and be on top of the world, in the world’s finance capital, Wall Street! I did what everyone else was doing – setting up interviews and researching these companies, to make sure I could hold my own when they started drilling me with questions. The process felt like a scene from any of these big corporate power movies – The Devil’s Advocate, The Firm, Wall Street. I wasn’t feeling it. I did get offers though, and considered them. But what really inspired me was the start-up technology world. I wanted to be a major part of a small team that took risks to bring new, innovative products and services to life. I didn’t have any experience in this area, being a new graduate, but I felt inspired when I read and thought about entrepreneurship. I had an inkling of a vision for my career track, and it didn’t have big corporate offices and a Wall Street lifestyle in it. Not that there is anything wrong with that – in fact, I have many friends that went on that track, and have done very well, financially and personally. It just wasn’t for me, and something inside my being knew it. So I took a chance by joining my friend, Charles Balsamo, at a small startup called Exeter Technologies. We were the Co-Founders – he was CEO and I was CFO, titles we knew little about, but grew into over the next three years. Actually, in a startup, you wear so many hats – I was doing all the Sales & Marketing, as well as some R&D, in addition to HR and Finances. It was the building of my foundation and experience in startup venture building – and I loved every minute of it, even the all-nighters, where we had to work around the clock to meet major deadlines. You see, when you really love what you do, it doesn’t feel like work. And that is what I have always sought after. 20 years later, I continue this journey, doing what I love every single day.\n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/6kdUQpjLGgKSo6y8OwWUMg/86045a88ada5294ff2809a9e6e990eda/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-23_.svg"},"type":"VISION CREATION","color":"#00B896","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Career Dreams","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"1I6eBw9oHqS6gi6oQSW4ky","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-03T03:50:45.775Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:24:45.596Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":4,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons- Day-23 ","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/1I6eBw9oHqS6gi6oQSW4ky/3d7b04c95fe2cc9c5a84afdc439dae4f/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-23_.png","details":{"size":16867,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-_Day-23_.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"snippet":"The same question that I posed on Day 13 comes up again – “To what degree are you doing what you love?” Today, the answer is a resounding “YES!!” Now what needs to be done over the next 5 years in order for that statement to become a reality?","audio":{"uri":"https://assets.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/1eNaDRymFQQMEkYQ8QgM4a/af4e17967019bda3f32968df6b114f8c/20-20-55-Phase-3-Step-23.mp3"},"checkin":{"text":"In step 23, you listed your large-scale career dreams.

This is not just about how much you have or make – it is about how you think and feel about the world of things, and how skillfully you are able to operate in that world. We’ve all heard the phrase “More Money, More Problems”, a popular lament of the rich and famous, who oftentimes have difficulty with managing money. While we may idolize these celebrities for their stature and seeming access to the finer things in life, how come it seems that many of them are not all that happy? I believe it has to do with two main factors:\n\n__1__- Money may be nice to have, and can surely temporarily help you live a more comfortable and stress-free lifestyle (if managed well), but it does not bring long-lasting joy.\n\n__2__- The energy surrounding money and material things is overwhelming, and attracts many negative forces. Think about the entourages and all-of-a-sudden “friends” that wealthy athletes have after signing big contracts. Everyone lining up for the money train, including financial “advisors”, lawyers and others that “want to help”, causing confusion and These folks did not build a proper Board of Advisors. \n\nYou don’t have to be multi-millionaire celebrities to experience these negative effects. The pure chase for money and things, as well as your insecurities over your financial status, can drain your vital energy, and sabotage positive traits. The trick is to build a positive relationship to the material world, and not let it take over our soul. \n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/4KBRtQduWc8k48aYqGyskG/7e9c56125643cc59c289e2eb7dca169c/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-24_.svg"},"type":"VISION CREATION","color":"#00B896","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Money Dreams","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"6RiNa6It2M2qsi20ek0IOQ","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-09-13T17:15:52.140Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:23:53.834Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-24)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/6RiNa6It2M2qsi20ek0IOQ/1d79c7dfdbe2efe4468479b88305ed73/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-24_.svg","details":{"size":307924,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-24).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Challenge yourself to think about your career Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs).

It’s David Owens from Step 16. This current Step is usually where you begin to bump up against some of the internal (e.g., inner negative voices) and external (e.g., finding time) obstacles that can prevent you from reaching your goals.  The good news is that, with persistence and creativity all the goals you seek to achieve can be accomplished. You have to be honest and fair though as well. \n \nFor example, if you’ve never run long distance in your life, you are potentially setting yourself up for failure if you aspire to run a marathon in one month, and do so in under 3 hours. Set goals that will inspire you to stretch yet that are also within your grasp, and not so challenging that you become discouraged. Also, don’t be afraid to try new things (other than a gym workout) that better fit your persona.  Try tai chi, yoga, Gyrotonic or swimming. \n\nRemember the basics: \n\n__Nutrition and Diet__\n\nThough it is cliché – you are what you eat. Being active is very important; but what you eat, the quality of the food, and the quantity are factors if not taken into consideration, can undo all of the hard work you put in. If you don’t like to cook, consider looking into food companies that make healthy prepackaged meals. If you like to cook or want to learn a new skill, the culinary arts are wide open for exploration.\n\n__Sleep__\n\nSleep hygiene is such a highly under-appreciated component to your health and well-being. Everyone has different requirements for the amount of sleep they need to operate at an optimal level, but the quality of the sleep is just as important. If you consistently need coffee or other stimulants to make it through the day, you’re not getting enough quality sleep. Try out a sleep ritual to help to slumber off. \n\n__Body Care__\n\nJust like a car, your body needs maintenance and check-ups (not necessarily of the medical doctor kind). Massage, acupuncture and chiropractic adjustments are some of the more pop- ular alternative means of self-care.\n\n__Mental and Emotional Health__\n\nAs a complex being, your mental and emotional health are key components to your physical health. Make sure you have someone to talk to, whether it’s a friend or a professional. We need to be heard and understood. \n","refAssignment":[],"icon":{"uri":"https://images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/16LMXn0DTGeCqqKewYwYS8/d635fd5be1faf6b55ff8a24051c69b56/TimeBug-Icons-_Step-26_.svg"},"type":"VISION CREATION","color":"#00B896","duration":30,"stepScreenDescription":"Health Dreams","shortIcon":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"6h184bey8vl3"}},"id":"4twOxB14U0kwqei6mok4wo","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2018-09-13T17:15:33.802Z","updatedAt":"2018-09-13T20:23:34.707Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment"}},"revision":3,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-26)","file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/4twOxB14U0kwqei6mok4wo/b8847a610174ab8cee8e949dbeb1b255/TimeBug-Icons-_Day-26_.svg","details":{"size":321618,"image":{"width":576,"height":576}},"fileName":"TimeBug-Icons-(Day-26).svg","contentType":"image/svg+xml"}}},"snippet":"Put away those inner negative voices and accept new ones that launch you into a new, healthier you.","audio":{"uri":"https://assets.ctfassets.net/6h184bey8vl3/4b5hp7pIaQEiiKy2UeE2EK/3f6ca6f9d55425f3cf64b8fa9dd3049d/20-20-61-Phase-3-Step-26.mp3"},"assignments":[{"icon":null,"content":"What changes and achievements will you make across the following areas?\n- Prioritizing your Health Goals vs. other Areas\n- Fitness & Exercise\n- Nutrition & Diet\n- Sleep\n- Body Care\n- Mental & Emotional Health "},{"icon":null,"content":"Who you want to make drastic improvements in their physical health?\nHow exactly do you want them to change?\nHow can you help them achieve this goal?

The deeper you go, the more your goals will fall into alignment with the Master plan.\n\nRemember your Board of Advisors, first introduced on Step 4? Good mentors tend to bring everything back to your life purpose and inner journey. There is so much controversy and differences of opinion regarding spiritual philosophy. There are also  a lot of pretenders and predators who don’t have either real knowledge or good intentions, but who prey off of others who are authentically eager and open to guidance. Follow your heart and intuition when it comes to aligning with any type of spiritual teacher or guide.\n\nToday, in building on the mentorship concept, I want to encourage you to consider what other types of support structures you have in your life. It’s not all about having a be-all, end-all mentor, which is not easy to find. \n\nSometimes, having peers, who are at or around your same level, can be as helpful as having a mentor; because those people are going through the same challenges as you are can relate.  Ideally, you would have both – guidance from those who have walked in your shoes and moved further along the path, as well as those who are walking the walk, right by your side. Be it a formal support group, or informal group of friends, you really need this type of support . \nWithout these support networks, its easier to fall back on bad habits, loneliness, depression and other “negative” emotions.
