Where do the deep link urls live?
----

- In JS Side it is in src/constants/index.js
- In Android: it is the last intent-filter in the `.MainActivity` activity tag on AndroidManifest located in /android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml.
- In iOS it in on ios/Lifevision/Info.plist inside `URL Types` (first one is our facebook URL) second one is the primary. ('lifevision' right now).

Setting up Universal Links and associated Domains: [more info here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html)

- Have a Signed `apple-app-site-association` JSON file.(Donâ€™t append .json to the `apple-app-site-association` filename.)
```
{
    "applinks": {
        "apps": [],
        "details": [
            {
                "appID": "9JA89QQLNQ.com.timebug.lifevisionApp",
                "paths": [ "*" ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
- Upload the `apple-app-site-association` file to your HTTPS web server. Place the file at the root of your server or in the .well-known subdirectory
