# Creating a test

- Create a directory for the test/suite of tests that you want to build inside `<rootDir>/tests`
- Create a file with the following name `<OriginalFileName>.test.js`
- Create your test accordingly
- Run `npm t` to determine that the tests all run correctly
- Commit the test (and snapshot if any) to git
